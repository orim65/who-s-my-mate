<p>I&apos;m pleased to finally have the opportunity to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. The Labor Party have been calling for years for this type of legislation to protect vulnerable workers, with no joy at all. Finally we have some action on protecting vulnerable workers, but it certainly does not go far enough. Having said that, it is, I guess, better than nothing, and this bill does go some way towards dealing with the exploitation that occurs across our economy in Australia. We support its passage through the Senate because, as I said, we are better off having something than nothing at all, which is what we have had for a number of years. The government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to act to protect vulnerable workers.</p><p>At the last election Labor had policies to combat sham contracting; to shut down the practices of companies, phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities; to reform the Fair Work Act to protect vulnerable workers; to criminalise employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats during the commission of serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act, particularly in relation to temporary overseas workers; and to make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages from employers and directors of responsible companies. This bill, however, does nothing to address these issues, and that is why I emphasise that this bill does not go far enough to protect vulnerable workers. It also does not protect workers from cuts to penalty rates made by this government. Up to 700,000 Australians will lose up to $77 per week—people who will have to work longer for less, women who will be disproportionately affected by those penalty rate cuts, and regional communities who will have less money spent in their economies. So there is a real need for this bill.</p><p>The issues that I&apos;ve just raised are of major concern to the opposition—to the Labor Party and to me personally. For some time now senators in this place would have been aware that I&apos;ve been on an inquiry looking at the introduction of a modern slavery act in Australia. A lot of the evidence that has been brought to our attention during the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&apos;s inquiry into modern slavery in Australia has included examples of some of the issues that were covered by Labor&apos;s policies at the last election. These included issues to do with coercion and threats by employers, particularly for temporary overseas workers, and issues to do with workers being unable to recover unpaid wages from their employers.</p><p>I would like to refer to the submission to the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act by The Freedom Partnership: End Modern Slavery—that is, the Salvation Army, as well as the Uniting Church of Australia, FECCA and ACRATH. In their very, very detailed submission, they give examples of workers who have not been protected. Indeed, I would like to share with the Senate one example of what modern slavery looks like in Australian supply chains across a range of industries. In fact, this example is about a man called Samuel Kautai. Samuel Kautai was a young man from the Cook Islands, who along with four other men, all around the ages of 17- and 18-years-old—just starting out in their working life—were recruited by an employer&apos;s brother in the construction industry and were promised that while they would not get any wages for the first three weeks, after that they would get paid the full amount, and be able to send money back home to their families in the Cook Islands. However, he was never paid more than $50 a month. This is here, in Australia. He was never paid any more than $50 a month. And worse than that, Samuel and some of his co-workers, were physically abused, underfed and endured long working hours without decent breaks. This case was pursued by the CFMEU under industrial mechanisms and by the NSW Police Force under state criminal law. The case was decided both times in favour of the applicant, which, of course, resulted in the employer having to pay back to Samuel Kautai and the other employees what they were duly and rightly owed.</p><p>When we talk about protecting vulnerable workers, we are talking about workers across a range of industries from construction to carpentry to welding to the meat industry as well as domestic workers, market garden workers, horticultural—I have so many examples in this submission to our modern slavery inquiry of workers who have simply been ripped off and who have been treated appallingly, all because of their employers obviously doing wrong by them, but also because we don&apos;t have legislation that provides those protections that Labor has been asking and urging this government to deliver.</p><p>These examples of exploitation make it clear that action is needed. For example, subcontractors&apos; exploitation—who were engaged by Myer employing cleaners on sham contracts under which workers were paid below award wages, denied penalty rates and superannuation, and worked without occupational health and safety protections—needs to end. Of course, we are all very familiar with what occurred with the 7-Eleven stores. They were operating a business model based on methodical, systematic exploitation of vulnerable foreign workers that included the gross underpayment of wages and doctoring of pay records designed to conceal unlawful conduct, and workers subjected to threats of deportation and physical intimidation. This has no place in a civilised society like ours. It has no place in Australia.</p><p>Protecting vulnerable workers is laudable, but, unfortunately, this government cannot be trusted when it comes to protecting vulnerable workers. We have concern that this bill gives coercive powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman without external scrutiny and oversight, and that it could be abused to investigate unions and industrial action rather than actually protecting the vulnerable workers that it needs to protect. We believe that this legislation needs to be amended to ensure that these powers can only be used in investigations into the underpayment of wages.</p><p>Labor will continue to lead the way in protecting vulnerable workers, be it through legislation or amendments to this bill in this place or be it through our work in support of the introduction of a modern slavery act similar to that in place in the UK, France and the Netherlands. And, of course, Labor will also ask for the Fair Work Ombudsman to have all the powers necessary to pursue employers who exploit workers. The Fair Work Ombudsman must have powers to be able to pursue those employers, whatever the case may be. But the powers, of course, must have proper oversight. That is what we are asking for in relation to this Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill.</p><p>As I outlined, this bill does fall significantly short of the suite of policy and legislative reforms that Labor first announced more than 12 months ago, before this Turnbull government even turned its mind to the notion of protecting vulnerable workers, because it&apos;s so caught up in its ideological obsession with unions and its lobbying against workers rather than actually standing up for their protection. I&apos;m pleased to have had the chance to speak on this bill. We&apos;ve been calling for action to protect these workers for a very long time without any joy. But something is better than nothing, and it&apos;s pleasing to see what we have before the Senate today. Let&apos;s strengthen this bill so that it can really do what it should do: protect vulnerable workers in Australia.</p> </speech>

<p>The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill—it&apos;s not a normal name for a bill that comes out of this government. But the circumstances are worth considering. It got to a point where there was such enormous pressure on the government that they had to do something. But when we look at the detail of the bill we see that something isn&apos;t adequate; it doesn&apos;t actually solve the problem. And the problem is enormous: extreme exploitation of some of the most vulnerable workers that we have in our society. The fact that the bill has been introduced is significant, but we need to look into the detail, and the Greens will be moving amendments similar to those that my colleague the Greens industrial relations spokesperson, Adam Bandt, moved in the other place.</p><p>This bill is before us because of the courage of a few people who really looked into what was going on with the franchisees to understand the conditions that the workers were existing under. It became apparent that they are very tough. For many of them, their lives are on hold because of uncertainty with regard to the wages that they will be paid, and even if they will be paid. A lot of these scandals started with 7-Eleven. We quickly learnt that one person&apos;s convenience store is often another person&apos;s workplace of extreme exploitation and rip-offs. What we learnt is that 7-Eleven is probably just the tip of the iceberg, because there&apos;s Caltex, Domino&apos;s and probably many others where the loopholes in the law are now well-known by the legal eagles who are employed. They&apos;ve worked out how they can become rich very quickly off the back of people who are actually keeping these businesses going.</p><p>These scams are extreme. It was found that some people were getting paid and were then being forced to give back part of their wages in so-called cashback scams. It was found that, so the proper payment and proper taxes did not have to be paid, the hours the people were being rostered for did not actually represent the hours they were working. It is a real scam of the books that has been going on for a long time and is now out in the open. We have the opportunity to clean it up, and clean it up properly, but that will only occur if this bill is amended.</p><p>What we also need to remember here is that the workforce that we&apos;re dealing with is often people with limited English or people who are from overseas and very worried that they may be under threat of being deported, even if they have a secure visa and it&apos;s totally legitimate that they live here. There have been many reports of intimidation, threats and insinuations made along the lines of, &apos;If you speak up, if you try to change things and get your proper pay, you could well be deported.&apos; That&apos;s deeply shocking, and it needs to be factored in to how we handle this situation.</p><p>In my opening remarks I said that we have this bill before us now largely because of the dedication of a few individuals. One of them is Michael Fraser, who really dug into what was going on here. With the 7-Eleven case, he went from store to store collecting stories, winning the understanding, support and confidence of the people working there so he could document what was really going on—the levels of oppression and exploitation that shouldn&apos;t be occurring in workplaces anywhere in Australia. There was also a group of Fairfax journalists who took on this story and reported it in detail—another factor leading to the government being forced to act. We also learned from their studies that it was not just the workers who were getting done over; the people who bought into these franchise operations were, in many instances, also being put in a situation where their income was greatly reduced—it was often quite minimal—because of the way head office operated, and they were under pretty clear directions that a lot of the money had to go back to head office. Again, it&apos;s worth looking into the operations here: (1) we need to understand it and (2) it informs us of why this bill is inadequate in its present form.</p><p>How do these franchises work? Most of us have had the experience of going into a 7-Eleven. Wherever you go, they all look pretty much the same in terms of the stock that they carry, where the stock is, the signage and all that sort of thing. This is how it operates: the head office dictates how these places are managed, micromanaging to the nth degree. But one aspect of how these small businesses—if we can use that term in this case—operate that isn&apos;t consistent is the payment of wages. This is where they seem to have a whole different set of standards. The small business franchisees that run the business carry the legal risk if there is underpayment. It&apos;s not the head office; it&apos;s not the billionaire who&apos;s sitting back, doing pretty well off the back of the hardship of so many of the workers in the industry. We see time and time again that the worker who sits at the bottom is the one who is being ripped off.</p><p>This is where we are again reminded of the failure of the bill before us, because it does not offer the protection that the title of the bill suggests. If you believed the title of the bill before us—&apos;protection of vulnerable workers&apos;—you&apos;d think it sounds pretty absolute, but that&apos;s not the case. What we need here is shared responsibility, and that is why we need to amend what&apos;s before us. The bill does not shift any responsibility back home to the owner—and they&apos;re really getting filthy rich off the way this system works. When you read the stories of the people who are making money for the people who own these companies, you see that what&apos;s going on is very ugly.</p><p>As I said, the bill does not make the head office responsible. Instead, it effectively says, &apos;You&apos;re only responsible if you knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that the franchisee was underpaying the worker.&apos; That&apos;s just passing the buck. It&apos;s simply unacceptable; it&apos;s been exposed and it has to change. That&apos;s why we&apos;re going to move to amend the bill—to close that loophole and make sure that the head office is responsible. That&apos;s the essence of what we&apos;re dealing with here. Really, the government should&apos;ve had a good look at the Greens&apos; bill that Adam Bandt, the MP for Melbourne, worked on. That really brings all these issues together and makes it very clear that we do need that shared responsibility, that you can&apos;t let the head office off the hook here.</p><p>So we will be moving an amendment that will make it very clear that, if you&apos;re a worker in one of these franchises—7-Eleven, Domino&apos;s or wherever—and you are underpaid, you can go straight to the head office and claim your underpayment. At the moment, it doesn&apos;t work that way. What happens is that the head office can just get out of it. We read that time and time again in those reports and articles about what was happening. They were just passing the buck back to the small business owners that they have further down their chain of command. This really does need to change here, otherwise what the government is doing is a farce. We need it set up so that if the worker wins a court case they can claim it against the head office. This is the key to achieving the protection that the government is stating is in this bill. Then it is up to the head office. They are then the ones who have to have the battle with the franchisees that they have brought in to run their stores. That is where the battle lies. Meanwhile, the workers who have been exploited and underpaid have been able to pick up their correct pay, because they have been able to go direct to the head office. It is a very simple requirement. The government has done a disservice here.</p><p>In many ways, it is classic in terms of what you see from Liberal-National parties when they are in government. They will often try to walk both sides of the road, particularly when a problem has been identified where the business world is doing the wrong thing. They will say, &apos;We&apos;ll bring in a correction; we&apos;ll fix this up,&apos; but they have left the loopholes in the bill so that big business can still, effectively, get away with so much of the exploitation. Again, let&apos;s remind ourselves: it should not be the worker left in limbo trying to work out how they get their money, who owes them money and who can actually pay them. That is what was revealed in so many of the reports that exposed how so many of the companies were working. Whether it is 7-Eleven, Domino&apos;s or Caltex, there is a similar pattern. It is ruthless; it must stop. We have the opportunity right now to stop this level of exploitation.</p><p>I can&apos;t emphasise enough: it should not be up to the individual worker to try and work out who is the person responsible for the underpayment and who will actually pay them the money. We have to get rid of the tricks—and there are tricks in the legislation before us. Our amendment effectively says that the worker can go directly to the head office and get their money back. Then we&apos;re leaving it up to the franchisees and the head offices to fight it out and to work out how they are going to undertake their business model. It really does need to change. It really needs to recognise that people have rights and that they can&apos;t use some legal scams to get away with what&apos;s currently going on.</p><p>So, yes, we do need this legislation, but to be effective it does need to be considerably amended. I look forward to the discussion at the committee stage.</p> </speech>

<p>I, too, am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. I&apos;m going to make a very boring contribution following the media superstar, Senator Rhiannon, but I&apos;ll do my best!</p><p>A lot has been said over the last couple of months since this bill was brought on for consideration by this parliament, highlighting a great many examples of abuse of vulnerable workers and business enterprises taking advantage of those who may not be able to stand up for themselves. So I too am willing to commend the government for bringing on this legislation and for putting in place some protections and setting up a regime, or attempting to set up a regime, that will actually do something to provide some protections for workers who, as I say, may not be able to stand up for themselves.</p><p>We have seen companies such as 7-Eleven, Muffin Break, Gloria Jean&apos;s and Caltex—to name a few household brands—implicated in the allegations made about underpayment of vulnerable workers. Not having as much air time are the widespread ramifications flowing from underpayment of workers. These people have families. They have bills to pay. If they are underpaid, meeting those obligations is very, very difficult. It also has an impact on other businesses that are doing the right thing. Those who are paying the right amount—and, in some cases, more than the award rate—have an increased cost to doing business compared to those who are flouting the law and taking advantage of vulnerable workers. That&apos;s why this legislation is so incredibly important. It is why I am going to commend it to the Senate.</p><p>The Fair Work Ombudsman in its submission to the Senate inquiry on this legislation gave a great many accounts of the breaches that it had investigated and that were reported to it and the impacts that this has had on individual companies and individual human beings who were caught up in these cases. We heard stories of migrant workers being paid as little as $14.12 or $10 an hour, well below the federal minimum wage, which is something none of us should stand by and condone. That&apos;s exactly what we&apos;re getting at here—trying to crack down on this sort of behaviour. There were also stories of young people being forced to accept non-cash payments of pizza and soft drink rather than being paid the money that they were entitled to be paid. It&apos;s just unconscionable that any business proprietor or senior manager in any business entity would seek to take away from someone what they are entitled to be given in return for the work that they are contributing. So, when you hear of people doing this sort of thing, providing in-kind payment, as they would probably refer to it, in the form of sugary drinks and fast food, rather than the money they need to pay for whatever it is they need to pay for—the power bill, rent and food—it&apos;s just not good enough.</p><p>The Fair Work Ombudsman&apos;s submission to the inquiry looked at what action has been taken by business operators to evade compliance efforts. There were some startling things—for example, phoenixing, where companies liquidate and then set up a new business to avoid any liabilities that have accrued against that business in not paying what employees are due; the failure to keep records or falsifying the records that do exist, making it difficult to verify the hours that have been worked and what workers have been paid for the hours they are supposed to have worked; engaging in the cashback schemes, which I will touch on later; and targeting vulnerable workers who are less aware of their rights and less likely to report problems for a whole range of reasons, such as language barriers, a lack of familiarity around the mechanisms that are available to vulnerable workers and the protections that might be available. There are all sorts of problems. Then, of course, as we&apos;ve heard before, workers have been threatened with their visa or their job—&apos;If you don&apos;t take what I&apos;m giving you, I&apos;m going to send you home and seek that your visa be cancelled, or I&apos;ll terminate your employment and you won&apos;t have any money.&apos;</p><p>I want to quote from a couple of parts of the Fair Work Ombudsman&apos;s submission because I think it&apos;s important to look at some of the things that it said. This entity works at the coalface. This is the entity that receives the complaints. This is the entity that deals with the allegations and gets to the bottom of what&apos;s going on and tries to do the right thing by the people who are purportedly being ripped off. The Fair Work Ombudsman&apos;s submission says on page 7, paragraph 17:</p><p class="italic">In some of these cases, the existing framework has not been sufficient to deter ongoing and systemic conduct across sectors, industries and regions, and usually with respect to these workers. Some unscrupulous employers view non-compliance as a business model and do not fear being caught out for their behaviours, or consider penalties associated with their breaches of the law an acceptable cost of doing business. These employers often do not keep proper records or payslips and are unwilling to engage with the FWO in an investigation.</p><p>That gives you an insight into what the Fair Work Ombudsman is dealing with in trying to get to the bottom of these things. The fact that the Fair Work Ombudsman acknowledges in its submission that there are business operators who see this as a way of doing business—a worthwhile risk; something that they are willing to sort of take a chance on in the event that they get caught out and may have to pay a fine—is just unbelievable. How these people can sleep at night, thinking, &apos;It is worth it in the end,&apos; all the while inflicting some sort of misery on individuals who have been underpaid is certainly not something that is at all Australian. Again, that&apos;s why I&apos;m so pleased that we are considering this legislation today.</p><p>Moving to paragraph 23, the submission goes on to say:</p><p class="italic">The package of measures outlined in the Bill together would make a significant difference to FWO&apos;s capacity to address this conduct where it occurs. In particular, providing higher penalties that reflect the gravity of serious contraventions of the law and ensuring there are real deterrents against not keeping records or falsifying records for the purpose of disguising underpayments. Ensuring Fair Work inspectors are taken seriously and cannot simply be ignored will make a significant difference when tackling the worst sort of conduct.</p><p>The FWO refers to, in the broad, the amendments proposed in this piece of legislation, saying that these will help them do their job—to deal with those dodgy operators who falsify, destroy, don&apos;t keep records and who think they can get away with ignoring the FWO when they come knocking, saying: &apos;Hey, we have examples or complaints against your business suggesting that you&apos;re engaging in this sort of conduct. We want you to provide evidence that this is not the case.&apos; I think the fact that they&apos;re going to be able to clamp down on that is an excellent thing and something I look forward to seeing the results of as we move forward.</p><p>Moving to the conclusion of the Fair Work Ombudsman&apos;s submission to the inquiry, paragraph 113, they conclude by saying:</p><p class="italic">As the FWO has noted, the regulatory framework is fit for purpose in most circumstances but is not sufficient to deal with the most egregious behaviour in matters involving the exploitation of vulnerable workers. The proposed amendments would enhance the FWO’s ability to deal with serious and concerning conduct within the jurisdiction of the FW Act and contribute to efforts across government and within communities to address the drivers of workplace exploitation.</p><p>As I say, this is from the people who are at the coalface of dealing with this issue, of dealing with the complaints from vulnerable workers, their family, their friends and other employee-representative organisations who become aware of this stuff. To hear them make those comments about what this bill will do—the people who have to go out and apply it—is encouraging.</p><p>Fundamentally, when we do see this abuse of power—be it the employer, a senior manager or someone from any other representative organisation exploiting vulnerable workers—it is incumbent upon us to take action. This legislation does exactly that. Under the amendments contained in the bill, as has been stated in previous contributions, the franchisor will, in certain circumstances, become liable where a franchisee or one of the franchisor&apos;s subsidiaries violates specific sections of the act, such as the National Employment Standards, any modern awards, methods and frequency of payments, or record-keeping obligations. Most of those are very straightforward and, I think, speak for themselves.</p><p>Much has been made in the debate about the transfer or liability to the franchisor, so it&apos;s important to set out exactly what the amendments will establish and in what circumstances they&apos;d be applied. The amendments introduced the notion of serious contraventions to apply deliberate and systematic breaches. They strengthen the liability and responsibility of franchisors for the business conduct in the franchises under their direction. It&apos;s important, though, to point out that the breaches targeted through these amendments differ greatly from the genuine mistakes—and they occur. I&apos;m aware of one in Hobart, which attracted a great deal of media attention which was a genuine mistake. It was a business that had engaged the services of a third party to do its bookkeeping, a reputable firm. Clearly, this reputable firm and the individual they sent along to do this business&apos;s books didn&apos;t know what they were doing. As a result, the staff were underpaid a significant amount and this business was dealt with under the law. As with many of these cases, a significant amount of public attention was given to this business, somewhat unfairly. All the same, it will be nice to see these genuine mistakes, if they can be properly demonstrated, taken out of the basket that some of these more dodgy operators should be kept in and dealt with. In doing that, there is the three-stage test, to determine whether or not this is a genuine mistake, that must be satisfied before the franchisor can be held responsible. That test is as follows:</p><p class="italic">… the franchisor:</p><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><p>Those three steps do establish a bit of a mental intent test, for want of a better expression, to ensure that the entity against whom the complaint is being made was seeking to actually do what has been done and that is the subject of the complaint.</p><p>The bill also seeks to define a &apos;serious contravention&apos; as one that is intentional and is part of a systematic pattern relating to one or more individuals. Again it points to it being something that&apos;s planned or deliberate and is happening to a number of employees, rather than just one out of 30 or 10. Further, the bill notes elements that the court may give regard to when assessing whether a systematic pattern exists. So there are going to be strict tests under the law that the courts will adhere to when assessing these things.</p><p>A &apos;responsible franchisor&apos; is one who has a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee entity&apos;s affairs. The bill aims to ensure that franchisees and franchisors are held responsible for a series of contraventions, including underpayments and sham contracting, which we&apos;ve heard a lot about in the debate over the last day or two. The bill also extends accessorial liability to franchisors where they knew or should have known that contraventions were occurring in one of their franchises. This liability means that an individual or company involved in the breach would also be potentially responsible in situations where they were not directly participating in the breach itself. So the amendments will apply to both franchisors and master franchisors if they exercise a significant level of influence or control over the franchisee&apos;s activities. The amendments do provide exemptions for franchisors in circumstances where they can demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to prevent contraventions and there were no reasonable steps they could have taken to prevent such a contravention from taking place.</p><p>Other provisions include increasing penalties tenfold for serious contraventions of specific parts of the act and for failure to maintain proper records. Individuals who engage in serious contraventions face a maximum penalty of 600 penalty units, which is $108,000, and companies could face a penalty of $540,000. That is, as stated, a tenfold increase on the current penalties and represents the government&apos;s resolve to deter these sorts of practices. I think it&apos;s important to note that, in the submissions to the inquiry, a number of entities said that the penalties didn&apos;t go far enough and others said that they went too far. To my mind, when you see those sorts of comments being made, it often means that you&apos;ve got the balance right. Certain entities with certain interests believe that we&apos;re going a bit hard and others would like to see us go harder.</p><p>Further amendments outlaw the cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees may be paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages. I heard Senator Williams explaining yesterday this disgraceful conduct. In some cases it has been suggested that the employer marches the employee down to the ATM and asks them to hand back a portion of what they&apos;ve been paid. To see employers trying to make it look like they&apos;re doing the right thing on paper—&apos;We&apos;ve paid them X amount this week&apos;—and then forcing their employee to give back a certain amount, because they were threatening them with having their visa removed or terminating their employment, is just disgraceful.</p><p>The EM for the bill specifically references the inquiry into the 7-Eleven scandal, which we&apos;ve all heard and read so much about, and their involvement in cashback practices. It&apos;s important to note through this scrutiny and in debating this legislation that it was just some franchisees who did this and that others did pay their employees the lawful rate. Again, in the same case that had received so much public attention, the franchisee then deliberately falsified records to disguise underpayments. This practice, which clearly demonstrates that these businesses were seeking to deliberately rip off employees and hide it from the public and from the regulator, is exactly what we should be looking for and catching out. The amendments hold franchisors and companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. The bill also builds on steps already taken by the government to protect vulnerable workers and broadens the circumstances in which franchisors can be held responsible for employment law breaches by their franchisees.</p><p>I will now touch on some of the contributions made by some of my colleagues yesterday in the debate. It&apos;s always good to listen to Senator Helen Polley and the contributions she makes in these debates. And I&apos;m disappointed that I haven&apos;t yet heard Senator Bilyk&apos;s contributions, but I look forward to listening to that afterwards. Senator Polley referenced earlier on, consistent with some submitters to the inquiry, that the bill didn&apos;t go far enough. I make the point that there were some submitters who said it went too far, again pointing to the fact that the balance in this bill is right. And, when you take that into account with the amendments that have been proposed in the majority report on the inquiry into this bill, I think that the bill is exactly what we should be passing.</p><p>I have been amused at the reference to cuts to penalty rates and how that somehow gets intertwined into the substance of this bill. I accept it&apos;s an issue that there has been a great deal of public debate on. I don&apos;t think that I need to point out, for those who have listened to the debates on that issue, the rewriting of history from the opposition with regard to that. But it&apos;s very convenient. And, when they can conflate that into this attack on workers, then—</p> </speech>

<p>All points to the opposition for trying, but, when it isn&apos;t material to the substance of this bill, I do have to question why it does get raised. But I do understand that there is a pitch out there in the community to try to paint Australia as the most unequal society in the world and that it&apos;s all because of this government.

<p>I&apos;m pleased that I was given some time today to talk on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It&apos;s good that, having seen levels of abuse of workers&apos; rights that not even this government could ignore, we are finally presented with the bill. Over the last couple of years, just some of the high-profile cases of exploitation of workers we&apos;ve heard about include 7-Eleven shop assistants, Myer cleaners and Pizza Hut delivery drivers. But what we need to remember is that not all cases have been high profile. There has been consistent evidence of the exploitation of workers taking place over quite some time.</p><p>It is utterly despicable that in 2017 we&apos;re still hearing of exploitation of workers on such a large scale. Labor senators welcome the provisions of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, which will reduce the exploitation of some vulnerable workers in Australia. However, Labor senators consider that in some aspects the bill as currently drafted falls well short of addressing the range of ways workers are exploited. It falls significantly short on the suite of legislative measures required to properly address the breadth of worker exploitation.</p><p>For those who said that the bill has gone too far, I would suggest that they possibly don&apos;t like accountability, because the bill does nothing in relation to sham contracting, phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities or reforms to the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers, and it does nothing to make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages. As such, Labor senators believe that a number of amendments are required in order to provide a more comprehensive solution to the very deliberate and systematic exploitation of workers in Australian workplaces. It could be a better bill, and if the Senate accepts our amendments, it will be, but I do acknowledge that it is a start.</p><p>I shouldn&apos;t have to say it, especially here in the Australian Senate, but throughout the country employees shouldn&apos;t be ripped off by their employer, ever—full stop. Employees should be fairly paid in line with their agreements and the law. Employers shouldn&apos;t deliberately rob their workers to boost their own profits. We should be a better nation than that. However, we&apos;ve seen in the last couple of years gross, systemic and wilful exploitation of workers, in particular, by some very large national franchises. This is completely unacceptable. It&apos;s unacceptable to the employees and to the employers who are placed at a competitive disadvantage by doing the right thing and paying award wages or over award wages, and who aren&apos;t exploiting their workers. It&apos;s unacceptable to the union movement and it&apos;s unacceptable to our sense as a nation of the fair go.</p><p>The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 amends the Fair Work Act to increase penalties for serious contraventions defined as conduct which is:</p><p class="italic">(a) deliberate; and</p><p class="italic">(b) part of a systematic pattern of conduct relating to one or more other persons—</p><p>of prescribed workplace laws. Also:</p><ul></ul><ul></ul><p>And the franchisor or holding company may raise a defence of taking reasonable steps to prevent a contravention, and:</p><ul></ul><p>giving the Fair Work Ombudsman and employees at SES level the power to compulsorily question persons as part of an investigation in to the breaches of the Fair Work Act where failure to answer questions gives rise to a civil liability.</p><p>As I said, those measures are a start, but they don&apos;t go far enough. But there&apos;s a policy that does properly protect workers&apos; rights. Labor&apos;s rights at work policy released at the start of 2016 committed a Labor government to put in place a suite of reforms to protect rights at work by cracking down on unscrupulous employers who are willing to exploit employees.</p><p>Labor&apos;s Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 is a far more comprehensive suite of measures to protect vulnerable workers. As an example, our bill contains amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009, which make it clear that the Fair Work Act applies to all employees, irrespective of their immigration status; require the Fair Work Ombudsman to publish information for employees about the relationship between workplace and immigration laws and the right of overseas workers to seek redress for contraventions of workplace laws; provide additional protection from adverse action taken against an employee who questions whether a workplace right exists or whether they&apos;re an employee and not an independent contractor; introduce a reasonable person test in determining whether an employer has engaged in sham contracting; give the court the power to make orders requiring directors of phoenix companies to pay unpaid wages and other employee entitlements when a company of which they&apos;re a director is phoenixed; increase threefold the maximum penalty for employers, other than small businesses, who deliberately and systematically deny workers the wages they are due; give the courts the power to disqualify directors involved in companies that are found to have deliberately engaged in serious contraventions of workplace relations laws; and introduce new criminal offences for conduct that involves the use of coercion or threat within the meaning of slavery or slavery conditions of the Criminal Code where employers commit serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act in relation to temporary overseas workers.</p><p>Labor&apos;s bill is significantly better than the one presented today. I would like to take a moment to talk about the importance of ensuring that franchisors ensure franchisees are in compliance with the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Ombudsman in the report into 7-Eleven found:</p><p class="italic">It is our opinion that 7-Eleven had a reasonable basis on which to inquire and to act. To the extent that 7-Eleven contends that issues were limited to the few rather than the many, the Fair Work Ombudsman provided evidence of widespread compliance risks across the network in October 2014 at the commencement of the inquiry and again in May 2015 when presented with the preliminary findings of the 20 stores audited in September 2014.</p><p>So, in other words, 7-Eleven knew of the behaviour that had been going on across its franchisees for many years, yet they did nothing to protect the workers. This is utterly shameful. In addition, the Fair Work Ombudsman&apos;s 7-Eleven report said:</p><p class="italic">While 7-Eleven is not legally responsible for entitlements payable to employees of franchisees, it has a moral and ethical responsibility for what has occurred within its network and is capable of preventing it occurring again.</p><p>On this same issue, Labor senators, in their additional comments to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee&apos;s report into this bill, noted:</p><p class="italic">… the concerns raised by submitters such as WEstjustice that the bill as currently drafted does not make it clear that responsible franchisor entities and holding companies will be liable for the breaches of the franchisee entity or subsidiary.</p><p>Labor senators also consider that the bill does not go far enough in its amendments to expand accessorial liability. As the Franchise Council of Australia argued:</p><p class="italic">No evidence provided makes the case for singling out franchising when Fair Work compliance concerns are an economy-wide issue.</p><p>Labor senators contend that this evidence supports the need for liability to be extended so that franchisors cannot avoid responsibility by merely rearranging their affairs. Employers shouldn&apos;t be able to wash their hands by shifting employees to labour hire firms. This is one of the reasons that the bill, as originally drafted, doesn&apos;t go far enough.</p><p>However, just protecting workers from exploitation is not enough. We also have to work to protect their take-home pay. Of course, we all know that penalty rates are of vital importance to low-paid workers, and on this the government has failed those workers again. I often wonder if those on the other side of the chamber have ever had to rely on penalty rates—not just getting them from working a part-time job while living with mum and dad and all the comforts of home but actually relying on them. We&apos;re not just talking about students and young people; we&apos;re talking about 700,000 people: mothers and fathers, carers, primary bread winners for families. If those opposite really understood, they would side with our lowest paid workers and make their lives a little easier. But those opposite are not the ones negatively impacted by penalty rate cuts.</p><p>Labor does not accept the failed, flawed, sterile view of this country that says you reward those at the very top and hope that something trickles down to everyone else. It&apos;s clear to see that this government&apos;s priorities are utterly wrong. The last thing Australia needs is a cut to household budgets, which are already stretched to the last dollar. When corporate profits are at record highs and wages growth is at a record low, it is not the time to give multinationals a tax cut and workers a pay cut. Australians facing a cut to their penalty rates just want someone to fight for them. Well, guess what? That&apos;s exactly what Labor is doing.</p><p>Those opposite say we should just accept the decision of the umpire. We respect the Fair Work Commission—absolutely we do—but they&apos;ve made the wrong decision in cutting Sunday penalty rates, and we will not stand idly by while Australia&apos;s lowest paid workers pay the price. A new Labor government will reverse this penalty rate cut and protect vulnerable workers from exploitation. I call upon the government and the crossbench to work with Labor, pass our amendments and leave this place with a significantly better bill. Our lowest paid and most vulnerable workers need legal protection from unscrupulous operators who are getting away with exploitation and theft. We should be making laws that protect the most vulnerable, not allowing these injustices to continue.</p> </speech>

<p>I rise to oppose a bill with a dishonest name. It&apos;s the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It doesn&apos;t promote fair work and it doesn&apos;t protect vulnerable workers. Like other industrial relations legislation, it destroys jobs and the lives of people who could fill those jobs. The bill raises penalties for paying a consenting adult $18 an hour, because the ban on low-skilled work, euphemistically called the minimum wage, is set at $18.29. This kills jobs, particularly for those unemployed Australians who are young, mature—or mature-ish, like me—disabled, have poor English or are fresh out of jail. Supporters of the minimum wage, to my left and right, are crushing the hopes of the most disadvantaged Australians. It is immoral.</p><p>The bill before us today also hits franchisors with $100,000 fines when someone else, a franchisee, does not comply with the fair work law, even though the franchisor does not know about, help or encourage the noncompliance. This is unjust. It&apos;s like a wrathful God incensed by the sins of the father and visiting them upon the son. It will also stop the franchise business model in its tracks. Australia will be forced back into the 1970s where, instead of a franchise restaurant or cafe, we ate at a local greasy spoon and, instead of ducking into an IGA to pick up some groceries, we would be lucky if we picked up a wilted lettuce at a dusty corner store. Businesses will become more and more reluctant to offer budding entrepreneurs a franchise, which is an easy way for them to start their own business. Instead, thousands of budding entrepreneurs will have to continue to work for the man, rather than become their own boss.</p><p>I will be moving amendments to soften the edges of this bill&apos;s attack on the franchise model. The Franchise Council of Australia, and many others, advised the Senate committee reviewing this bill that only those franchisors who influence their franchisees&apos; employment arrangements should be held responsible for a franchisee&apos;s noncompliance with employment law. The Senate committee recommended consideration of an amendment along these lines. I will move such an amendment, to be co-sponsored by Senator Bernardi. My amendment will add a condition to the definition of &apos;responsible franchisor entity&apos; so that not only does the franchisor need to have a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee&apos;s affairs but also the influence or control must relate to the franchisee&apos;s compliance with workplace laws. It won&apos;t be sufficient if a franchisor only has influence over the size of the pickle in a franchisee&apos;s Big Mac.</p><p>My amendment will also make a corresponding change to the related civil remedy provisions. Currently, these provisions establish a contravention if the responsible franchisor entity knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that its franchisee would fail to comply with workplace laws. They also establish a contravention if a body corporate knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that its subsidiary would fail to comply with workplace laws. With my amendment, the contraventions would arise only if the franchisor or body corporate would know these things, or ought to know these things, in the ordinary course of business. So, if a franchisor hears from a loudmouth taxi driver that his barber said that he heard from his next door neighbour that the franchisee is paying below the minimum wage, the franchisor won&apos;t have broken the law simply because of these Chinese whispers.</p><p>This is a bill of the Liberal-National government and it is furiously supported by Labor and the Greens. These major parties pretend that fairness can be achieved by making a declaration in legislation rather than through voluntary deals struck between established businesses, budding entrepreneurs and workers. The Liberal Democrats stand against this madness. Just like the emperor has no clothes, the fair work system actually isn&apos;t fair.</p> </speech>

<p>The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 is a lame attempt by this government to deal with a real crisis that we&apos;re facing in this country, and that is the crisis of wage theft that is rampant across our economy and rampant across a wide variety of industries and is, as a result, seeing the gross exploitation of far too many working people in this country. The bill is a very belated effort by this government to deal with the unbelievable exploitation of workers that we witnessed occurring at the 7-Eleven chain of stores a number of years ago. It&apos;s been years since this exploitation was revealed by media outlets, and, for years, the Labor Party, trade unions and many others in our community have been calling this government for action. Now, finally, we see the government coming forward with legislation, which, to some extent, deals with these issues but doesn&apos;t go anywhere near far enough.</p><p>I&apos;m very proud of the fact that the workers who were exploited by 7-Eleven were represented by my former law firm, Maurice Blackburn Lawyers. I pay tribute to the efforts of Giri Sivaraman and his team at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, who took on these cases on a pro bono basis and, as a result of the legal action taken on behalf of these workers, have managed to extract, literally, millions of dollars in underpayments to workers, many of whom came to Australia on temporary visas. That work has gone some way to rectify the massive losses that these exploited workers suffered.</p><p>In the interest of time, I will give a couple of quick examples of the kinds of conditions that people working at 7-Eleven were experiencing. The first claimant commenced working at 7-Eleven on a bridging visa B. They worked at three different 7-Eleven stores between 2011 and 2014. In total, this claimant was underpaid over $180,000, including interest. At one store, the claimant was required to work many weeks unpaid, which the franchisee characterised as training. At each store, he was paid below the award rate. He was paid somewhere between $10 and $12 per hour, well below the award rate. He was not paid overtime, was not paid penalty rates, was not paid for all the hours worked and wasn&apos;t provided with rest or meal breaks. For some time, the claimant worked 60 or 70 hours a week between all three stores. At one point in time, he worked 110 hours in a week. The claimant received deliberately falsified pay slips that halved the hours he actually worked. He was robbed twice in one day by a man with a serrated knife, and he was forced by the franchisee to work the next day. So he was robbed by an armed robber twice in one day and then his franchisee at 7-Eleven turned around and robbed him again by underpaying him.</p><p>The second claimant that I&apos;ll mention worked at two different 7-Eleven stores between 2005 and 2006. This claimant was underpaid by nearly $100,000, including interest. At one store, he was required to complete 32 hours of unpaid alleged training. Money was deducted from his pay if customers drove off without paying for fuel. Can you imagine the cruelty of an employer who would actually do that to someone! Not only would the employer underpay them and not pay them for alleged training but, if their customers drove off without paying for fuel, they would also take that out of the worker&apos;s pay packet. At each store, this person was paid below the award rate, not paid over time, not paid penalty rates, not paid for all hours worked and not provided with rest or meal breaks. At one store he worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for over six months. That&apos;s not to mention the fact that this particular claimant&apos;s wife was extremely ill with stage 4 cancer.</p><p>These are the kinds of stories that emerged as a result of media coverage of the disgraceful behaviour of 7-Eleven and the complete lack of responsibility taken by their senior management, the franchisors, in the behaviour of their franchisees. The thing I remember most from talking to my former colleagues at Maurice Blackburn who were working on the case was that, no matter how bad you thought the behaviour of 7-Eleven was—and it was absolutely abominable behaviour—in many instances, for those people they were acting for who were working at 7-Eleven, that was their second, better paid job, because they were working elsewhere getting even more exploited than they were at 7-Eleven. That gives you some idea of the scale of wage theft and exploitation that is happening in this country. But it&apos;s not just 7-Eleven where this is happening. We&apos;ve seen many other exposes through the great work of people like Adele Ferguson and her team at Fairfax Media, exposing the behaviour of Caltex, BP, Pizza Hut and Domino&apos;s.</p><p>Some of the worst instances we&apos;ve seen have been in the meat-processing industry, particularly a company called Baiada and the way that they have been treating their workers in North Queensland. This is not an issue that is restricted to one particular company or one particular business model being franchised; this is something happening right across our economy and right across every kind of employment relationship that we see. I have seen it myself, both on the Gold Coast and in Central Queensland, those being the two major parts of Queensland that I represent, and it&apos;s really got to stop.</p><p>The fact that this is happening beyond one business tells you that this is actually a business model that is being adopted by a large number of companies right around this country, and the only way they are staying in business and the only way they are delivering profits to their owners is by ripping off highly vulnerable workers. As I said, this bill is the government&apos;s alleged attempt to respond to this problem.</p><p>Now, I do welcome the changes that the government is making in this bill, but they go nowhere near enough to deal with the scale and breadth of problems that we are seeing happen in our economy through exploitation of vulnerable workers. This bill doesn&apos;t address the problems that we are seeing around sham contracting, where many workers, who any objective test of whether they are an employee or not would say that they are an employee and therefore entitled to the rights that come with employment—leave, superannuation and all sorts of other rights that come with being an employee—but instead these people are being treated as contractors and denied rights. The bill does nothing about that.</p><p>This bill does nothing about phoenixing, which we&apos;re seeing not only in the construction industry but in security, in cleaning and in a whole range of industries. This is where people are employed by one firm and underpaid—or not paid at all in some cases. Then the business is shut down overnight and the assets moved to another company, which starts operating the next day under a different guise, and the people who have worked there and have gone unpaid end up losing out.</p><p>This bill does nothing about the problems that we&apos;re seeing around exploitation of people through labour hire. Obviously, that is something I have spoken about on a number of occasions in the chamber, particularly in relation to the problems that we have seen in Central Queensland in the mining industry. People are being sacked from permanent employment and the very same day mining companies are bringing people on through labour-hire arrangements, paying them less pay and giving them worse conditions. This bill does nothing about that. It does nothing to stop the incredible growth in casualisation that we&apos;re seeing right throughout the economy as well, where people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent work. And of course this bill does nothing whatsoever to reverse the recent decision of the Fair Work Commission to cut people&apos;s penalty rates, which will have a dreadful effect not only on working people&apos;s budgets but on the economy overall.</p><p>Labor is going to step up to the challenge and is going to put forward some amendments in this debate that do try to deal with some of these other problems that we&apos;re seeing in the economy. We&apos;re going to put forward amendments which prohibit unreasonable demands for money by employers to prospective employees. This bill does go some way to stopping employers from demanding money be paid to them by current employees, with the threat hanging over them that if they don&apos;t pay that money they could be deported, lose their visa or lose their job. But this does nothing to stop employers from making the same kinds of threats and demanding money from prospective employees. Recently, we saw instances where a Domino&apos;s franchisee demanded around $150,000, I think it was, from someone in order to get a job. If they didn&apos;t pay that money, they weren&apos;t going to get the job and they were being threatened with immigration reprisals. One of the amendments that Labor is also going to put forward for this bill is to extend the liability of franchisors to labour-hire and supply chains.</p><p>This bill does do some good things in making franchisors liable, in some instances, for the actions of their franchisees. If their franchisees are underpaying their workers then, in some instances, franchisors will be held responsible. But we know very well—and every week new cases surface, whether they be in Central Queensland, the Gold Coast or other parts of Australia—that host companies are engaging dodgy labour-hire firms to bring people in on below-award illegal rates of pay and are getting away with it, because the workers who are brought in by these labour-hire firms are too scared to complain because they are in fear of losing their jobs. Currently, there is nothing in Australian law that stops a labour-hire company from doing that unless those laws are enforced. And currently there is no obligation whatsoever on a host employer to make sure that a labour-hire firm that they engage is doing the right thing and paying people the appropriate wages and conditions.</p><p>Big employers should not be allowed to get away with using labour-hire firms to underpay their workers. If a big firm—whether it be a mining company, a retail chain or whoever—engages a labour hire firm which then goes on to pay someone below the legal rates and conditions, then the host employer, the person who has engaged the labour hire firm, should be held responsible. The bill does nothing about that. It is time we took steps to correct firms who are doing the wrong thing. I&apos;m very pleased that Labor will be moving amendments to that effect, and I look forward to joining the debate when we get to those amendments.</p> </speech>

<p>I rise to make a contribution in respect of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. As previous Labor senators in this debate have indicated, whilst we are glad that the government has taken some tentative steps to address the issue, in the face of the egregious examples of abuse by certain franchise companies these steps are woefully inadequate. We have seen very many examples of this, and I will talk a bit about that as well.</p><p>This bill has been a long time coming. It does do a few things worthy of note. Among other things, it introduces a new civil remedy offence of &apos;unreasonably requiring an employee to spend or pay an amount of their money in relation to the performance of work&apos;. The Senate committee inquiry in relation to the bill revealed stakeholder concerns that this new offence will not cover unreasonable demands made by employers to prospective employees as a condition of employment. This is of serious concern. This is a serious deficiency in the bill.</p><p>Additionally, as highlighted in the submission by Morris Blackburn—a firm that has a lot of experience representing workers, often on a pro bono basis—these proposed changes to the liabilities of franchisors do not go far enough. If we&apos;re talking about improving accountability and making sure workers are paid what they are owed, then these changes need to be stronger. The liability imposed by the proposed section 558B attaches only to a franchisor who is a responsible franchisor entity. The bill defines this as a franchisor that has &apos;a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee entity&apos;s affairs&apos;. In short, I believe this change will merely encourage franchisors to operate at arm&apos;s length from franchisees to ensure that liability does not apply under section 558B. This change would have the effect of merely allowing franchisors to distance themselves from the alleged underpayment but would do nothing to stop the underpayment from occurring.</p><p>Secondly, there are additional protections for franchisors if they take what&apos;s referred to as &apos;reasonable steps to prevent a contravention&apos;. The prevention test describes it as &apos;the franchisor need only take pre-emptive action in advance of a contravention and will not be in breach of the provision if they fail to address the contravention once it has occurred or is occurring&apos;. This is an obvious flaw as, after becoming aware of the contravention, a franchisor can in essence do nothing and escape liability if it otherwise meets the prevention test in section 558B. It&apos;s concerning that meeting this prevention test could be as simple as a franchisor advising a franchisee of their obligation through a simple &apos;tick and flick&apos; checklist.</p><p>Given these weaknesses in the bill, it is my view that more scrutiny is warranted. And this is where we look at the egregious examples of abuse that came out in the 7-Eleven underpayment scandal. This profit-splitting arrangement, in which a franchisor took 57 per cent of profits made by franchisees and imposed a significant number of business expenses on the franchisees, actually incentivised franchisees&apos; noncompliance with the act as a way of recovering profits they had surrendered to the franchisor.</p><p>I was listening to Senator Williams&apos;s contribution in relation to this matter yesterday. Senator Williams advocated a review of the franchising arrangements. My personal view is that that is something which could be accommodated. There are some questions to be asked in relation to the franchising model and protecting franchisees and, in turn, protecting the rights of workers employed by the franchisees. The courts are needed here to examine if the business model of the franchisor has substantially contributed to franchisees breaking workplace law. Sadly, even when we have worker exploitation occurring on an industrial scale, this government has remained absent. We only need to look at 7-Eleven&apos;s dastardly attempts to minimise what&apos;s owed to employees, who have clearly been overworked and underpaid, yet this government has done nothing but produce weak legislation that will only have a slight impact in stopping this situation from occurring again.</p><p>Victims of this scandal are still being short-changed. Prakash Kumar, who was underpaid hundreds of thousands of dollars at a number of 7-Elevens, was offered a payout under the new scheme that is $100,000 less than the amount he originally claimed for. Another former 7-Eleven worker Raj Desia was made an offer by the panel of $60,986 which was $16,000 less than the amount he was owed. As recently as 25 July, a 7-Eleven owner in Brisbane was personally fined $28,000 and his company fined $140,000 by the Federal Circuit Court after he was found to have underpaid eight staff and falsified records to cover their tracks. This is an absolutely disgraceful situation. Australians expect that our industrial relations system is going to protect vulnerable workers. When we have people coming into the country who are particularly vulnerable on visas, who are studying and who rely on their jobs in order to remain in the country, they particularly need to be protected. In the face of these egregious examples, we have a government which is not taking reasonable steps to address the issues. If the government was to get serious about assessing whether the franchisor has taken reasonable steps to ensure that exploitation doesn&apos;t occur, the bill should also require consideration of the vulnerability of workers to exploitation, such as young workers or workers on visas.</p><p>Submissions to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee&apos;s inquiry into the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 identified the behaviour allegedly engaged in by a Domino&apos;s franchise where sponsorship for a working visa and a job was offered on the condition of payment of $150,000, as an example. While it would appear that particular pre-employment requirement for an up-front payment linked to the provision of a visa may be prohibited by other legislation, other unreasonable pre-employment requirements are not. Stakeholders from business and unions made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry, raising concerns about the lack of oversight in the bill for the proposed new Fair Work Ombudsman compulsory questioning powers. Whilst Labor supports giving the FWO the powers necessary to prevent, uncover and prosecute the exploitation and underpayment of vulnerable workers, we are also concerned that these powers are exercised appropriately. We really need to address this particular issue. Unfortunately, this legislation doesn&apos;t go far enough, and there are a number of amendments that Labor has in mind here. These will certainly improve the effectiveness of the bill.</p><p>I have been participating in the Education and Employment References Committee&apos;s inquiry into corporate avoidance of the Fair Work Act. I have heard numerous witnesses indicating to me that wage theft is now on the rise and is at historic levels in this country. It is quite clear to me that the Fair Work legislation is not working fairly for ordinary workers, particularly not for vulnerable workers. We need to have a thorough look at this issue. Unfortunately, the legislation we have before us at the moment is not going anywhere near addressing some of these issues. Senator Watt has touched on some of these issues. Other issues that should be looked at that require urgent attention are things like stopping sham contracting. I fully support any attempt to address that but, unfortunately, this bill doesn&apos;t go anywhere near that. Another issue is providing proper licensing for labour hire companies. Even the Franchise Council has indicated that the issues that came out, for example, in the 7-Eleven scandal, apply across the whole of the workforce, and the labour hire industry is also needing a bit of a shake-up. I note that the Queensland government has taken steps to introduce licensing arrangements here for labour hire companies, and we did start to look at this in relation to the backpacker tax at a federal level. There is also shutting down the practice of companies phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities; properly reforming the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers; criminalising employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats during the commission of serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act in relation to temporary overseas workers; and making it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages from employers and directors of responsible companies.</p><p>Having said that, I won&apos;t use all the time available to me, in the interests of trying to get on with the job of getting this bill done in a proper way. But, as I say, a number of these exploitation issues go across the economy. We support this bill with amendments. Quite frankly, the bill is better than nothing, and on that basis I commend it to the chamber.</p> </speech>

<p>I&apos;m pleased to talk about the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 today to highlight a group of vulnerable workers in Australia who are paid less than the minimum wage and aren&apos;t covered by the Fair Work Act. They don&apos;t have federal occupational health and safety protections or workers compensation and they can&apos;t take annual leave, sick leave or carers leave. They don&apos;t get a fair day&apos;s pay for a fair day&apos;s work. More than 33,000 workers, because that&apos;s what they are, come under the Community Development Program. Of the 33,000, 31,000, or 94 per cent, are Indigenous, mainly living in regional and remote Australia. Because of where they live, and because they are mainly Aboriginal, these workers are out of sight and out of mind for the majority of Australians. This policy forces the overwhelmingly Indigenous population of remote communities into labour with none of the benefits of employment enjoyed by every other Australian worker.</p><p>The union movement is deeply committed to ending this discriminatory CDP policy. Kara Keys from the ACTU described it by saying:</p><p class="italic">This is a program which discriminates on the basis of race, and has no place in a modern society.</p><p class="italic">The ACTU looks forward to a future in which all Australian workers are treated equally, Indigenous people are not treated as second-class workers and are given the same opportunities and rights at work that any Australian worker rightfully expects.</p><p>The First Nations Workers Alliance has been launched to give a voice to this group of workers, a group who often don&apos;t have a voice, let alone a national presence. I will say a bit about CDP. Participants undertake activities, including hygiene classes, T-shirt dyeing and art making. Some participants have described this aspect of CDP as taking part in adult child care. There is very little of community development in the approach. Participants can also spend up to six months in a workplace, which the government describes as a long-term work experience opportunity. Basically, though, it&apos;s a pool of free labour for employers to access in remote areas, and those employers have none of the responsibilities that we would normally expect to their employees. The First Nations Workers Alliance is campaigning for wage justice, an issue that is at the heart of the labour movement. I congratulate the ACTU and the union movement across the board for their support of the First Nations Workers Alliance.</p><p>On the International Day of the World&apos;s Indigenous Peoples, Labor stands with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to recommit to delivering a greater say on issues that affect their lives. It is a day that we celebrated only recently. We&apos;ve made it clear we support enshrining an Indigenous voice in our Constitution, because for too long First Australians have been excluded from the nation&apos;s birth certificate. Labor is committed to advancing the recommendations from the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Referendum Council&apos;s report. Labor has clearly outlined a bipartisan parliamentary process to make this recognition a reality. We are committed to deliver practical, community-driven measures to help close the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in every part of our national life, from education and employment to justice, housing and health. That&apos;s why we worked to set up the current Senate committee that is looking into the CDP.</p><p>I take this opportunity to thank all those organisations and individuals who&apos;ve made submissions and will give evidence in the coming weeks to this inquiry. I&apos;d like to share some of what people have already submitted. Mr Dereck Harris is chair of the Ngaanyatjarra Council, which delivers services to remote communities in WA just across the NT border. He makes it clear what happened when CDP replaced the old community development employment program: &apos;We feel the government stole our self-respect when CDP was taken away, and we will sink lower if we&apos;re forced to go on the healthy welfare card.&apos;</p><p>People worked for CDEP because they got paid money, but under CDP they come in because they don&apos;t want their pay to get stopped. It is a punitive system that is clearly discriminatory, does nothing to foster job development and employment, exploits workers and fails to develop and empower remote communities socially or economically. This legislation is better than nothing, but being better than nothing does not make it as good as it could have been. It offers limited protections to vulnerable workers but, I suspect, nothing at all to our most vulnerable workers: those on CDP living in remote areas.</p> </speech>

<p>As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise through the Pauline Hanson&apos;s One Nation Party on behalf of the people of Queensland to support the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, protecting unpaid workers and other vulnerable workers. My focus is on two aspects. I will start with the problems this bill addresses, and there are four main problems.</p><p>First, we have seen reports of the deliberate and widespread underpayment of workers. These have been too common in Australia. Allegations of underpayment have been raised in relation to major corporations 7-Eleven, Muffin Break, Gloria Jean&apos;s, Subway, Caltex, Domino&apos;s and Pizza Hut and their franchises. Second, this conduct by certain businesses is enabled by inadequate penalties and ineffective laws which fail to deter law-breaking and make worker exploitation difficult for the regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, to prove. The ALP was responsible for creating the Fair Work Act. Third, underpayment of workers is unfair for workers but also for competing small businesses who do the right thing and face higher costs because they are complying with the law. Fourth, when someone abuses their power, whether it be union bosses intimidating small businesses or dodgy employers exploiting vulnerable workers, the government must and should take action.</p><p>So the solutions in this bill as we see them are targeting serious contraventions and making franchisors and holding companies accountable. The bill as we understand it will, firstly, amend the Fair Work Act to increase penalties by 10 times for serious contraventions of payment related protections in the Fair Work Act. This will apply when contraventions are systemic and deliberate. The bill will raise penalties for record-keeping requirements to make them consistent with penalties for underpayment of workers.</p><p>Secondly, it will outlaw cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees may be paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages.</p><p>Thirdly, it will hold franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. We have also checked to make sure that, with regard to the varying franchisee/franchisor relationships, people who are not responsible won&apos;t be made accountable. This will hold accountable only those who are indeed responsible for payments.</p><p>Fourthly, it will strengthen investigation of underpayments by giving the Fair Work Ombudsman effective evidence-gathering powers and outlawing the provision of false and misleading information and the hindering and obstruction of inspectors who carry out investigations into compliance with the Fair Work Act.</p><p>It&apos;s quite clear, from the experience that many Australians have had and from the media reports, that these are urgently needed and necessary plugs in holes in Labor&apos;s Fair Work Act. While these are welcome, sadly, it only looks at one side of what makes workers vulnerable: underpayment. And I want to speak on behalf of vulnerable workers, because, including workers—</p><p>Debate interrupted.</p> </speech>

<p>It is probably best for Senator Sterle not to open his mouth and confirm people&apos;s views. Mr President, following a review of Defence support to anti-domestic-terrorism arrangements initiated last year, the government has made a number of changes that will facilitate Defence working with federal, state and territory police in the event of a terrorist incident. Clearly, state and territory police forces remain the best first response to terrorist incidents immediately after an attack starts. However, it is the case that Defence can offer more support to states and territories to enhance their capabilities and increase their understanding of Defence&apos;s unique capabilities to ensure a comprehensive response to potential terrorist attacks.</p><p>Under the changes, Defence will offer states specialised training for law enforcement teams. Defence will also offer states placement of ADF officers within law enforcement agencies to assist with liaison and strengthen the call-out provisions in the Defence Act. These changes will ensure that Defence is better able to support states and territories in preparing for terrorist incidents. They will enable a more comprehensive ADF response to a terrorist incident if required, and they will improve information flows between the ADF and police during an incident.</p><p>Together, these measures will further develop our nation&apos;s ability to respond to terrorism as well as to improve the effectiveness of Defence&apos;s contribution to domestic counterterrorism arrangements. As we have, unfortunately, seen in recent weeks—and I note the vital work of our security agencies in disrupting a plot to bring down a passenger aircraft in this country—we can&apos;t have a &apos;set and forget&apos; approach to national security. We must stay ahead of the evolving terrorist threat, which is exactly what the changes we have made will work to ensure.</p> </speech>

<p>The main role for Defence is of course conducting counterterrorism operations offshore. The ADF continues to make very significant contributions to countering terrorism in the Middle East and in Afghanistan. Following the liberation of Mosul last month, the ADF continues to conduct operations in Iraq to defeat Daesh, which has now lost more than 70 per cent of the territory it once held. The move to liberate Talifah is expected by September as planning is completed.</p><p>Australia remains strongly committed to the coalition and will continue to support Iraq and its security forces to ensure this brutal terrorist organisation is defeated and not able to spread its toxic ideology. In Afghanistan, the ADF continues to train, advise and assist the Afghan National Security Forces in their fight against the Taliban. It is in our long-term interests as a nation to ensure that terrorism is defeated at its source and safe havens are denied.</p> </speech>

<p>Further to my previous response: as Daesh is defeated in Iraq and Syria, the terrorist threat in our region is growing because terrorist fighters seek to return to the Indo-Pacific. So we recognise that effective cooperation is vital to defeat that threat. The ADF has an extensive program of counterterrorism engagement and capacity-building activities with our regional partners, including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.</p><p>We are also a strong contributor, through Defence, to the regional frameworks in our region that foster cooperation on counterterrorism and other shared challenges. Australia will continue to work closely with our regional partners and allies to help to counter the terrorist threat. Indeed, in the next week, I look forward to the opportunity to visit Singapore, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam to consult with my counterparts and to focus on those key regional relationships.</p> </speech>

<p>Well, no, I can&apos;t confirm that at all, Senator Chisholm, because that is not the only relevant fact—and if you reflected on the matter for a moment you would realise what a foolish suggestion that is.</p><p>But I think we do now know who is under acknowledgement or allegiance of a foreign power, and it is not Mr Joyce and it&apos;s not Senator Canavan: it&apos;s Mr Bill Shorten. Because what we&apos;ve had confirmed today is that the Australian Labor Party, in conspiracy with the New Zealand Labour Party, has been using the parliamentary processes of New Zealand, a foreign government, to subvert the government of Australia—to subvert the government of Australia!

<p>Yes, I can confirm that Senator Canavan had that to say and I can also confirm, as I pointed out to one of your colleagues yesterday, that the legal and factual issues of the two cases are quite different.

Just as he betrayed both prime ministers whom he served in government and just as he betrayed the workers whose interests he was entrusted with when he was a trade union leader, now he has done something which is even more serious—even more treacherous—than that.

<p>Senator Di Natale, we don&apos;t believe that. When your former colleagues, Mr Ludlam and Ms Waters, chose to resign that was their decision. Now, they say, and I believe you say, that they made their decision on legal advice. I haven&apos;t seen that legal advice and I can&apos;t comment on it. But you, Senator Di Natale, yourself moved the motion under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to refer the cases to the Court of Disputed Returns. It was an option available to you, and available to them, to make that reference under Section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and wait until the Court of Disputed Returns had determined their eligibility. But, you chose not to do that. They chose not to do that. They chose to resign. They didn&apos;t have to resign, but they did. Perhaps that was a catastrophic error of judgement on their part. But, in any event, we&apos;re all in the hands of the legal advice that we receive.</p><p>The government has received advice from Dr Steven Donaghue, the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, and, on the basis of Dr Donaghue&apos;s advice, the government is confident that both Senator Canavan and Mr Joyce would be found by the Court of Disputed Returns to be within, not beyond, the disqualification provisions of subparagraph 1 of section 44 of the Constitution. We have a body and legal authority, referred to by the Solicitor-General, which is reasonably well known—including Sykes v Cleary—to support that position. I wonder if those who gave legal advice to Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters also considered what the judges of the High Court would have to say in Sykes v Cleary, and, had they done so, whether they might have advised a different course?</p> </speech>

<p>My colleagues did the honourable thing, the decent thing, the right thing. They acted with integrity because, when they stood down from parliament, they upheld the Constitution. We then saw Senator Canavan adopt some sort of halfway house of being a member of this parliament while no longer being a minister. We&apos;ve now seen the Deputy Prime Minister stoop even lower.

<p>Senator Di Natale, you speak about integrity. I don&apos;t deny, by the way, that Mr Ludlam and Ms Waters did act with integrity. I suspect that they probably acted a little prematurely in resigning, but the government, you&apos;ll recall, Senator Di Natale, did support your reference, under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, as the appropriate course. I don&apos;t criticise your conduct in this, and I don&apos;t criticise the conduct of Senator Roberts either, but the point you make, Senator Di Natale, reminds us that it behoves every member of this chamber and of the other place to behave with integrity if they have reason to be concerned that there may be an issue about their citizenship. They ought to come forward, as your colleagues did, and as my colleague did. And we wonder why it is that nobody from the Australian Labor Party, about some of whose members serious doubts have been expressed, has shown the same integrity. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, Senator Nash. According to the Aged Care Act 1997, aged-care providers must maintain an adequate number of appropriate skilled staff to ensure that care needs of care recipients are met. Given the recent media reports of increasing numbers of incidents in aged-care facilities, with many families&apos; members citing understaffing as a huge concern, can the government explain why aged-care homes are not legislated to roster a registered nurse 24 hours a day to ensure better treatment and care for the elderly?</p> </speech>

<p>I thank the senator for the advance notice of her question and note her very genuine interest in this matter. I also note that it&apos;s her first question in this place.</p><p>The Minister for Aged Care&apos;s office has provided me with some information, which I am very happy to provide for the benefit of the Senate, but I would also be more than happy to arrange for a follow-up briefing for the senator with the minister. Under the Aged Care Act, approved providers of residential aged care are required by law to meet quality standards to ensure quality care and services are provided to all care recipients. This includes maintaining an adequate number of appropriately skilled staff to ensure that the care needs of care recipients are met.</p><p>The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency monitors aged-care homes against quality standards and undertakes at least one unannounced site visit per year. This includes interviewing care recipients about their experiences of care and services that they receive. Under these standards, approved providers must ensure there are adequate numbers of appropriately skilled staff to care for recipients&apos; needs. If a provider is not meeting its legislative obligations, the Department of Health may take regulatory action, including imposing sanctions. Anyone who has concerns about matters affecting the care of residents can contact the Commonwealth&apos;s Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. There are strict confidentiality and anonymity provisions within aged-care legislation that ensure that people who request confidentiality are protected from having their identity disclosed.</p> </speech>

<p>I thank the minister for her answer. Unlike childcare centres, hospitals and schools, there is no federal legislative requirement for aged-care homes in Australia to have staff-to-resident ratios or skill prerequisites. Given the frailty and vulnerability of the elderly in our aged-care homes, will the government consider following Victoria&apos;s Safe Patient Care (Nurse to Patient and Midwife to Patient Ratios) Act to prescribe ratios for registered nurses in all aged-care homes in Australia?</p> </speech>

<p>I do recognise that this is an issue for many people across our communities who are concerned about elderly people. Indeed, as somebody who has had a parent in an aged-care home, I understand how important this issue is. I&apos;m advised that the issue of staff ratios was raised in the Productivity Commission&apos;s <i>Caring for older </i><i>A</i><i>ustralians </i>report and that the commission noted the diversity of stakeholder perspectives on this issue.</p><p>While the commission expressed the view that at this stage the introduction of a simple staff ratio would not be a positive reform, it did not make any recommendations on staff ratios. The report observed that, at this stage, the imposition of a simple staff ratio is a relatively blunt instrument, particularly given that the care-resident profile of every facility will be ever changing.</p><p>Minister Wyatt announced during the May 2017 budget $2 million for an industry-led task force that will look closely at a range of matters, including quality assurance. Details of this task force, including the membership and terms of reference, will be announced in the coming weeks. Again, I can offer the senator a briefing, if it would be appropriate, to be available.</p> </speech>

<p>Yes, I can. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, continues to have serious questions to answer in relation to the $100,000 donation from the AWU to GetUp! that was made when he was both the National Secretary of the AWU and a board member of GetUp! Despite calls from several persons for Mr Shorten or the AWU to produce the relevant records evidencing that this donation was properly authorised by the AWU in accordance with the union&apos;s rules, both parties have failed to do so. Mr Shorten has to date, through his office, obfuscated and merely referred the question back to the AWU. This is despite the fact that Mr Shorten, at the time that the donation was made, both was the National Secretary of the AWU and was quite happy to take the credit for the donation. A spokesperson for Mr Shorten was quoted as saying:</p><p class="italic">The AWU was proud to support the establishment of GetUp!</p><p>But they continue to refuse to produce the required documentation. Mr Shorten has also failed to advise whether he disclosed this clear conflict of interest. Here&apos;s another question for the members of the AWU: why would the AWU be donating $100,000 of your money to GetUp! when the AWU represents workers in the mining, steel and gas industries? How is it in the interests of these workers for their union to fund GetUp! campaigns against the resources industry or gas exploration? In fact, how did these workers benefit from the GetUp! campaign for the carbon tax and in relation to their current campaign for higher electricity prices which will get rid of their jobs? <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>Because the rules of the union actually require it. The rules of the union are there to, allegedly, protect the members of the registered organisations. Whether you are a registered employer organisation or a registered employee organisation, you need to ensure that the members&apos; fees are used in the best interests of the members, not for the personal political ambitions of the leaders. Workers deserve to know that the union&apos;s money, which is ultimately their money, is being spent appropriately. We have seen multiple examples in recent years where union membership fees have not been spent in the best interests of the workers. We saw it with Craig Thomson; we saw it with Michael Williamson; we saw it with Derrick Belan—and the list goes on.

<p>Senator Lambie, thank you very much for your question. I know personally a number of Vietnam veterans, including my partner&apos;s father and many of his friends. Vietnam veterans have taught Australia and Australians a salutary lesson about how we should address rehabilitation, how we should approach the conversation that you have raised. I haven&apos;t had the benefit of reading the entire report to which I think you may be referring, but, in the decades that have passed since that time, we have incorporated those lessons and endeavoured to make more responsive the processes that we use and the work that the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs does. Senator Lambie, you know that it has been an extraordinarily dynamic environment in recent times. We have a growth in the number of ex-service organisations way beyond the days of the RSL, and many of us have watched them grow and supported them in their work and the efforts that they make.</p><p>What we do know is: we must have a much more effective transition from Defence to ex-Defence, if you like—from being a serving member of the ADF to being a veteran, who may or may not be supported by Veterans&apos; Affairs, because we are, of course, aware that not every veteran chooses to engage in that way. In that conversation, Minister Tehan and I are working very hard on a much more seamless transition between the two organisations to make sure that nobody leaves Defence without the material and the support they need to function and to provide for themselves in a world outside that environment. That may relate to medical records. It might relate to financial records. It might relate to psychological challenges. It might relate to all of those things combined. So we work very hard to make that transition as seamless as we possibly can.</p> </speech>

<p>Thank you, Senator Lambie. There are a number of outstanding issues, most certainly, between the veterans community and government. Governments of both colours, if you like, have been able to address some of those over time; others have not been resolved. They&apos;re matters that I discuss with the Minister for Veterans&apos; Affairs, and for that matter the Prime Minister, on a regular basis.

<p>I&apos;m not able to comment on the Minister for Veterans&apos; Affairs&apos; particular remarks. I&apos;m not sure to what Senior Lambie is referring, to be honest. But clearly in the operation of government, whether it&apos;s the Department of Defence or the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs, there are things that we do well; there are things that we can always do better. I think it&apos;s important for government to be able to acknowledge that, and that&apos;s one of the reasons I referred to our efforts to ensure a seamless transition for those who are wishing to leave Defence into the veteran space, whether they are a client of the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs or not. It is very important for us to acknowledge the service that those men and women have given and what they have given to their country—not just them but their families—and to make sure that we support them as best we are possibly able to in the time after they leave the Defence organisation.</p> </speech>

<p>Mr President, may I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of rail job delegates and thank them for their service to the country.</p><p>My question is to the Minister for Industry and Science, Senator Sinodinos. The New South Wales government&apos;s purchase of Korean built intercity trains will require massive modifications, including the replacement or shifting of 75 kilometres of rail line and overhead wires in the Blue Mountains and the wrecking of heritage stations.

<p>I thank the honourable member for his question. I also recognise the delegates, and I&apos;ll be seeing them after question time and we&apos;ll be having a good discussion about all of this. When I spoke at the Manufacturing Summit some weeks ago here, I talked about the government&apos;s plans in relation to the rail sector, including the fact that we do want to look at the concept of a continuous build when it comes to aspects of rail manufacturing and construction here in Australia. We have to recognise we&apos;re not as competitive in this sector as we could be, because of scale considerations. But we believe that with smart manufacturing we can do much better in this particular sector.</p><p>What gives me great optimism that we&apos;ll be able to do that is the fact that this government, in this budget, featured a $20 billion long-term investment in passenger and freight rail, including a $10 billion National Rail Program for urban and regional passenger rail, an additional $8.4 billion to deliver the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail freight link, and more than $1.3 billion for regional rail projects in Victoria, the Perth METRONET and faster city-regional connections. In other words, we are amping up our effort as a country in the rail sector. This provides us with an opportunity to come up with a national rail plan in a way that creates a globally competitive industry in this regard.</p> </speech>

<p>Again I thank the honourable senator for his question. I can report on a number of things. The federal Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development is supporting Victoria to lead the development of national rolling stock standards and eventually a national rolling stock procurement approach. The council agreed to Victoria leading the initiative on behalf of the jurisdictions, leading a process to progress the harmonisation of rolling stock standards and moving towards the development of a coordinated rolling stock procurement and maintenance pipeline. The TRC have agreed that train frameworks for wheels, windows and other glass componentry are the priorities for creating harmonised standards across the country. Jurisdictions are working with the Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board to draft high-level specification and guidelines for a harmonised and uniform market approach that can be used by state governments when procuring rolling stock. This will reduce procurement costs and create the conditions for Australian manufacturers to deliver economies of scale. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>Again I thank the minister for his answer. Despite the government&apos;s efforts, nothing has been done that will actually stop the governments such as New South Wales in their decision last year awarding $8.3 billion worth of contract work for New South Wales rail lines—some 6½ thousand tonnes of steel for the Metro Northwest project. Nothing&apos;s being done for state governments to award contracts for overseas builds of railway carriages. Is that not correct?</p> </speech>

<p>The first point to make is, of course, that these are decisions for state governments, but our engagement with them through this Commonwealth-state process I&apos;m talking about is to create the conditions where we can create that pipeline of projects which gives some certainty to the industry about the demand that is coming, creates some sort of scale and gives us an opportunity to use smart manufacturing to achieve more in Australia. It&apos;s best, I think, to avoid confrontation and talk with the states through the Transport and Infrastructure Council to get this done.

<p>I thank Senator Duniam for his question. The reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission by the Turnbull government is, as we know, working to restore law and order on building sites in Australia. This is despite those on the other side and their masters in the CFMEU who fought us every step of the way to try and ensure the CFMEU continued to control the building and construction industry in Australia. I have been overwhelmed by support coming from, in particular, small and medium subcontractors in the building and construction industry, in particular following the Senate last week upholding the Building Code in Australia. Again, this was despite some of the most disgraceful bullying, thuggery and intimidation I have ever seen. I again thank the Nick Xenophon Team, Pauline Hanson&apos;s One Nation and Senators Hinch, Leyonhjelm, Bernardi and Gichuhi for their support but in particular for throwing their support behind the small and medium subcontractors in Australia.</p><p>As we know, the ABCC is working. It is working to ensure that the lawless action on our building sites by the CFMEU is stopped. All too often what we see in Australia is sites closed down because of action that is taken by the CFMEU. At this point in time, it is a reminder that there are around 93 CFMEU officials before the courts for more than 1,369 suspected contraventions. As we know, in recent years the courts have imposed more than $10 million in fines against the CFMEU. In the words of a Federal Court judge: &apos;The CFMEU&apos;s record of noncompliance with the law is notorious. Their record ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement.&apos;</p> </speech>

<p>The minister confirmed that, in response to an FOI, his department discovered no documents of discussions between the department and Foxtel about the government&apos;s plan to give Foxtel $30 million.

The FOI request from the ABC <i>Mornings</i> program related to pre-budget correspondence between the government and the stakeholder in question.

<p>I thank the honourable senator for his question and his interest in all matters scientific. He is a great Western Australian. Yes, I did launch National Science Week last Thursday. Senator Bilyk was there with me. We had a great time. What a privilege it was to be there as minister for science in a room full of great scientists, including our Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt, leaders of our science organisations—Questacon, the Australian Academy of Science and others—and, importantly, high school science teachers. A great number of high school students have been working away over the last eight months in 17 schools across the country on the first Young Australians&apos; Plan for the Planet. It is an initiative that gets young people looking at the challenges we face, drawing on their STEM skills, articulating the questions and developing methodologies for coming to solutions—in other words, learning the scientific method and learning how to be scientists. This is a program that will be built on each year from now and will go to schools overseas.</p><p>The government is supporting this year&apos;s National Science Week by providing $500,000 in grants for 39 projects under the Inspiring Australia—Science Engagement Program. More than 1.3 million people are registered for more than 2,000 events across the country through to 20 August. There are hands-on activities, competitions, plenty to do online, astronauts at the Sydney Opera House explaining to people what it takes to have a mission to Mars—this sort of thing—and a young guy who did a video trying to explain how it is that cats when they fall off a table land on their feet, and that&apos;s being used by space scientists to work out how we should walk in space. No, it&apos;s about exciting the scientific curiosity of our young people and getting more young people involved in science, technology, engineering and maths.</p> </speech>

<p>Yes, that&apos;s right! I might be walking in space! National Science Week is for everyone.

I will be launching the Star Portal, a great initiative of the Chief Scientist in partnership with some of Australia&apos;s biggest institutions. It is an open access web database of extracurricular STEM programs and activities on offer around the country especially designed for students, teachers and parents. As part of CSIRO&apos;s STEM in Schools program for Science Week I will be going to a small primary school in Gundaroo to take part in a virtual classroom run by Australian scientists working in the space industry.

<p>In my portfolio science has its own importance in its own right. It is critical, though, to see science in the broader context of innovation and industry. The National Science Statement, released in March, set out the government&apos;s vision for an Australian society engaged in and enriched by science. The government will take a strategic view of skills and talent, ensuring Australians have the broad base of STEM skills required for the workforce of the future. Through our National Innovation and Science Agenda&apos;s Inspiring Australia—Science Engagement Program, we are promoting participation in STEM through sponsorship grants, Citizen Science Grants, the Maker Projects and the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship grants. We will be investing over $10.3 billion in research and development, including $3.6 billion in university research and a record $794 million for the CSIRO. Under our Innovation and Science Agenda, looking to the longer term, we are investing $2.3 billion over 10 years to support our critical research infrastructure.</p> </speech>

<p>Well, far from that, I often speak with the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court about these very matters. I find Chief Judge Pascoe to be an extremely constructive interlocutor as we work together to deal with this issue. Chief Judge Pascoe was integrally involved in the selection of the best person to take the vacancy in Newcastle, and it was thanks to Chief Judge Pascoe&apos;s advice that we were able, after a period of careful search, to identify the ideal candidate. When she is identified, I think you will agree with me, Senator Dastyari, that the person about to be appointed—or whom the government will recommend to His Excellency the Governor-General for appointment—will be a very sound choice.</p> </speech>

<p>Far from it. This government has in fact invested more in domestic violence and family violence services than any other Australian government. We&apos;ve done that in this year&apos;s budget.

We&apos;ve done it through increased funding, which Senator Cash and I announced, for the Third Action Plan for the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children.

<p>I would like to thank Senator O&apos;Sullivan and acknowledge his longstanding interest in this area, particularly in his state of Queensland. Because economic development is at the heart of this government&apos;s partnership with Indigenous Australians, Indigenous Australians must be at the forefront of development opportunities if we&apos;re going to build wealth and prosperity that we need to improve the outcome of our First Australians. We are delivering across a range of programs. We&apos;re investing in businesses to build local economies and communities across regional and remote Australia—places like Aurukun and Mount Isa, in the senator&apos;s home state. We on this side understand that the needs of Indigenous businesses differ between the cities and the bush.</p><p>We&apos;ve established a $90 million Indigenous Entrepreneurs Fund to help Indigenous businesses get a foot in the door. Under this fund, there are principally two types of support: a business advisory support and grants for plant and equipment. By investing in today&apos;s Indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs, our government is fostering a generation of entrepreneurs who will build their own business knowledge, their own assets and their own wealth. Most importantly, Indigenous businesses will employ the next generation of Indigenous workers.</p><p>I would like to also acknowledge the words of my colleague Senator Dodson, who said:</p><p class="italic">We need to recognise that the best way of dealing with problems is with respect, working together, and focussed on commonly agreed goals.</p><p>We on this side are working hard to get Indigenous jobseekers in a position to support engagement and to support employment in remote communities. Through our Community Development Program, we have supported 15,000 jobs that have actually been real jobs, away from a Work for the Dole program. Over 5,000 of these have been there now for over six months. And can I report that the CDP in Galiwinku has now trained jobseekers in construction of their own houses and they&apos;re transitioning into full-time employment. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>We know that the best way to guarantee success is to work in close partnership with our First Australians to promote economic development in their own communities. Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to be on Gumatj country in the Northern Territory and saw the outstanding success of the Gumatj corporation in growing wealth and generating jobs for their people. It was a great occasion to be at Garma with the Prime Minister and to witness the Gumatj corporation sign off on their own mining agreement. This is on top of a coffee shop, a nursery, a sawmill, a furniture factory, a cattle enterprise, a butcher shop and a fishing enterprise. They&apos;re now going into mining on their own country. The government has made it possible, with an investment of $800,000, to establish a mine training centre. And, again, on the Gumatj corporation&apos;s advice, they built the entire mine training centre, which is really value adding.</p> </speech>

<p>We are working with Indigenous Australians across a range of measures to generate wealth and to build their local economies. And, as we have acknowledged for many years, land tenure has to be progressed to deliver long-term economic outcomes for traditional owners.</p><p>We&apos;re making sure the notion of &apos;land rich and dirt poor&apos; no longer applies to our First Australians.

<p>&apos;Oh shush&apos;—yes, I know. I ask: when did we last win at Eden Park? Apparently it was in 1986, so reflect upon how long ago that was. I know there are things which are upsetting in the bilateral relationship, but really, this &apos;Kiwis under the bed&apos; daft line that this government has come up with is laughable—except that it is more than laughable; it is much worse.</p><p>I am extremely disappointed in my colleague, Ms Bishop—who, despite our differences, I do think is a credible and hardworking foreign minister—who was presumably sent out today to launch an extraordinary partisan attack on our friends across the Tasman. It really was an extraordinary attack. She managed to attack both the government, by refusing to believe the Minister of Internal Affairs when he said that this issue of Mr Joyce&apos;s citizenship had been raised at their end by the media—she refused to believe him—and then she attacked the New Zealand Labour Party. It is really an extraordinarily disappointing thing that we have an Australian foreign minister who has been prepared, and/or has been sent out—it reflects badly on either the Prime Minister or on her—to risk relations with our close friend and ally, simply to distract attention from the crisis that is facing the government.</p><p>It is an extraordinary attack, and I would ask the government—I understand that they are very upset about Mr Joyce failing to do his paperwork—to reflect on the wisdom of using the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this way, and reflect on being prepared to risk our relationship with our very close friend New Zealand, in order to distract attention from the domestic political travails of the government. It is immature, it is childish and it is not the act of a mature government. Frankly, it is not the act of a mature Prime Minister. It really demonstrates this Prime Minister&apos;s glass jaw.</p><p>Of course—news flash—the Labor Party is actually not responsible for Barnaby Joyce&apos;s dad being a New Zealander. I know that might come as a surprise to a government that likes to blame the Australian Labor Party for everything, but we&apos;re actually not responsible for the fact that his dad&apos;s a New Zealander.</p><p>It has been a most unwise strategy from the Prime Minister and his senior ministers, including Senator Brandis, today. They have been prepared to attack others overseas and to risk an important bilateral relationship, simply in order to try and distract attention from the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister is a New Zealand citizen. The government would have been far better to have responded in a serious and mature fashion. Instead, we have what can only be described as a completely daft strategy of running a &apos;Kiwis under the bed&apos; defence. What I say to the government on this is: grow up. I think the Australian people would look most dimly on the way in which you have sought to hyperventilate and sought to attack an important relationship because of your political problems. It is an immature and childish approach from this government, and it is one that really does no cabinet minister, no foreign minister and certainly not the Prime Minister any credit.</p> </speech>

<p>New Zealand, of course, is a very close friend and ally of Australia, and we make no attack on the New Zealand government. We make no criticism of New Zealand. We make no attack on the relationship—of course we do not. Credible and hardworking though you may consider Ms Bishop to be as foreign minister, Senator Wong, I&apos;m afraid, after that contribution, the same compliment cannot be returned to you because, although New Zealand is a close friend and ally, of whose government and of whom we make no criticism whatever, nevertheless, it is a foreign nation, and if Senator Wong, who is supposed to be the shadow foreign minister, cannot understand that there is something extremely inappropriate about the Australian Labor Party using, in an underhand and devious way, the internal political processes of a foreign country, albeit a friendly foreign country, to subvert Australian political processes then she is not fit to be the shadow foreign minister. The view that I express is a view shared by none other than the Prime Minister of New Zealand himself, Mr Bill English, who a short while ago in answer to a question in the New Zealand parliament had this to say: &apos;These are serious issues, to interfere in another country&apos;s politics, and it appears that there has been a serious misjudgement by the member&apos;s fellow opposition party.&apos; The member he was referring to, Chris Hipkins, is a close associate of members of the Australian Labor Party. The fellow opposition party to which Mr Bill English was referring was none other than the Australian Labor Party.</p><p>The fact is that the issue of the citizenship of Mr Joyce is a legitimate matter for parliamentary debate in Australia. The government, in an extremely forthright manner, itself put this question onto the agenda. Nobody had the faintest inkling that Mr Joyce was going to rise in the House of Representatives at 10 am yesterday to indicate that he had been advised the previous Thursday by the New Zealand High Commission that they considered that he may be a citizen, by descent from his father, of New Zealand. He was under no pressure to do so, but he did, because having become aware of that matter it was his instinct as an honourable man to put the matter into the public arena and take the appropriate course, which he did. And, ever since, in the last 28 hours or so, the Australian Labor Party has done nothing but play politics with the matter.</p><p>We now know that, in pursuing their political vendetta against the Deputy Prime Minister, they have chosen not only to debate the matter here, or in the other place, or in the Australian media; they have also interfered in the processes of the New Zealand parliament by an underhand conspiracy with Mr Chris Hipkins, a New Zealand Labour member of Australia and an associate of various Australian Labor Party members of the parliament—including, by the way, Mr Perrett, the member for Moreton, our colleague Senator Catryna Bilyk from Tasmania and others.</p><p>You don&apos;t do that. You just don&apos;t do that. You don&apos;t use the processes of another country—you don&apos;t interfere in the processes of another country—to pursue a political campaign in Australia to try to bring down the Australian government. I am shocked at Senator Wong; I thought she was smarter than that. What is really revealing is that neither she nor her colleagues seem to grasp the significance of this behaviour. They seek to ridicule, they seek to belittle, but they don&apos;t grasp the significance of foreign interference in New Zealand and using New Zealand&apos;s parliamentary processes to prosecute an Australian argument. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>I&apos;m pleased to have the opportunity to follow the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I will direct a number of my remarks to the incredible double standards he is displaying in his response to the situation that now confronts the Deputy Prime Minister. Both yesterday in question time and today again, we have seen an extraordinary position taken by Senator Brandis, the first law officer of this country, who you would think would go out of his way to ensure that the law of this country and our Constitution was upheld. Instead, he is doing his usual twisting and turning—evasion—to try to preserve whatever remains of his government&apos;s political honour.</p><p>I had a look back at some of the comments that Senator Brandis made in question time yesterday, which he went on to repeat today. In answer to Senator Cameron&apos;s question about what the difference was between the situation Senator Canavan found himself in before—properly—standing aside and the one the Deputy Prime Minister now faces, Senator Brandis said:</p><p class="italic">There are obvious factual and legal differences between the two cases.</p><p>He didn&apos;t want to comment about what they were. He said:</p><p class="italic">Suffice it to say that, when acquainted with the situation on 25 July and on the basis of his understanding of the facts at that time, Senator Canavan decided that he would prefer to stand down. The facts of Mr Joyce&apos;s case are much clearer to us than were the facts as known to Senator Canavan at the time he made his decision.</p><p>I was shocked when I heard Senator Brandis make those comments. In essence, his argument was and seems to remain, based on his comments today, that in Senator Canavan&apos;s case the facts and the situation were unclear and, therefore, the right thing for him to do was to stand down from his ministry, while in the Deputy Prime Minister&apos;s case the facts are very clear—that he is a dual citizen, that he is a citizen of New Zealand—but for some reason he should remain in office as Deputy Prime Minister of this country.</p><p>Surely, if anything, it would be exactly the opposite. Surely, if anything, if a minister&apos;s situation is crystal clear, as is the case with the Deputy Prime Minister, that minister should be standing down immediately. It should be the minister whose situation is unclear who might just have an argument that he should remain in his position while the situation is clarified by the court. But instead we have the first law officer of this country getting up and trying to argue exactly the opposite. All I can hope—</p> </speech>

<p>I will take Senator Brandis&apos;s interjection. He&apos;s maintaining this argument that the facts are clear, in the Deputy Prime Minister&apos;s case, that he is a New Zealander. He is 100 per cent New Zealand, and yet he can continue to serve in this government. The fact that the Deputy Prime Minister remains in office, and the fact that we have the Attorney-General and every other minister defending the right of the Deputy Prime Minister to remain in that position, not only shows the great illegitimacy in their government but also shows exactly how beholden the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister are to the National Party to remain in office.</p><p>Senator Brandis&apos;s other comments yesterday, in answer to a question from Senator Wong, were even more absurd. Senator Wong asked Senator Brandis:</p><p class="italic">Can the minister advise the Senate which of these &apos;factual and legal differences&apos; requires one minister to stand aside but permits another to continue?</p><p>Senator Brandis responded:</p><p class="italic">With respect, Senator Wong, it&apos;s not which factual and legal differences that is the point.

<p>It&apos;s with some sadness that I see and note and have to say that the Labor Party clearly have no idea of foreign matters and seek to trivialise very, very serious matters. It&apos;s like Senator Dastyari, when talking about the prospective major terrorist attack on an airline travelling out of Australia, equating it to his book being of halal standard. This is the Labor Party all over. They don&apos;t understand foreign affairs, and clearly none of the speakers who have spoken today, including, regrettably, the person who on a change of government would be foreign minister—and God forgive us that that may ever happen—understand what it&apos;s all about when an Australian parliamentarian like Mr Shorten can&apos;t prosecute his attacks or his vendettas within the Australian political scene but chooses to go to a foreign country to try to make a political point.</p><p>We are indeed fortunate in this country to have someone of the calibre of Julie Bishop as our foreign minister. She is universally recognised as a great foreign minister, and she continues to do that day by day. We&apos;re also extremely fortunate in Australia to have an Attorney-General of the capability and learning of Senator Brandis. In spite of the Labor Party&apos;s strange vendetta against Senator Brandis, continuing to bring up Senate inquiries into matters involving Senator Brandis, each one of those inquiries has clearly demonstrated that Senator Brandis has at all occasions discharged his duties in accordance with the law and extremely capably.</p><p>This is a sad day for the Australian parliament when an Australian political leader resorts to a foreign country to mount a political attack within Australia. As was said in question time, we know Mr Shorten has loyalty to very few—certainly not to the union members, $100,000 of whose money it appears he stole to give to a political party. Certainly not—</p> </speech>

<p>Whatever it is you want me to withdraw, I will. But, Madam Deputy President, I&apos;m always encouraged that, whenever I speak and particularly when I start exposing some truths about the Australian Labor Party, one of their members will take a point of order. I&apos;m gratified by that, because it always shows to me and anyone listening to this broadcast that you&apos;re on the right track.</p><p>It&apos;s clearly been exposed in question time today that Mr Shorten refuses to answer whether he had authority to give $100,000 of his union members&apos; money to a political party. We know Mr Shorten lacks any sense of loyalty to anyone—anyone close to him, anyone far from him, anyone in the political sense or anyone in Australian life generally. That is of course why Mr Shorten&apos;s standing in the opinion polls continues to plummet, and it&apos;s why we all know as experienced politicians that it won&apos;t be long before Mr Albanese makes the challenge to Mr Shorten&apos;s leadership. I hope he doesn&apos;t, because, from a political point of view, we would much rather have Mr Shorten as our opponent at the next election. But clearly those in the Labor Party are petrified at Mr Shorten leading them to the next election. We only await, with bated breath, Mr Shorten coming clean and answering some of the questions that have been raised about his use—or misuse, might I say—of the money that he had control over as the leader of the Australian Workers&apos; Union.</p><p>This is a sad day for the Australian parliament.

<p>I, too, wish to speak about the dysfunction we&apos;re seeing from the government on section 44 of the Constitution. I think that Senator Wong outlined the ridiculousness of the arguments the government have been putting around the Kiwis under the bed. My colleague Senator Watt highlighted the inconsistencies from the legal arguments we have seen from those opposite, particularly from the Attorney-General, George Brandis. We have seen Senator Canavan stand aside, but Barnaby Joyce, in the other house, refuses to do the same thing.</p><p>I think the important thing here is the dysfunction that the government have and the impact it is having on Australian families. That is something no-one has touched on yet; certainly, Senator Macdonald went nowhere near this. Let me talk about some of the issues that the government aren&apos;t dealing with because they are consumed about their own survival and increasingly desperate, as we have seen with their attacks today.</p><p>Let&apos;s talk about power prices. We hear a lot of those opposite come in and say that this is the most important issue, but what are they actually doing on it? We have seen no progress on this important issue, particularly when it comes to the clean energy target, in recent weeks. It is not even up for discussion from them in their caucus so far. We know that there is a war between the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister around the clean energy target. We want to see who is declared the winner. But in the meantime Australian families are paying more for power because of their inaction. The Labor Party are on the record saying we&apos;re willing to talk. We&apos;re willing to meet and compromise to bring in a clean energy target to provide certainty, but we see dysfunction and chaos on the other side. They are incapable of solving the issue.</p><p>Another issue close to my heart is the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. That is the fund that has not funded one single project. We know that the previous minister for this, Senator Canavan, has stood aside. The current minister responsible is the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, who is now also under a cloud. The people of northern Australia are crying out for jobs, as Senator Macdonald well knows, but because of the dysfunction of this government not one project has been funded. There will probably be more delays because of the change in ministers we&apos;ve had, and we will probably end up with another change in the ministry soon.</p><p>I spoke last night about the National Broadband Network. There is a growing crisis in the community with regard to people switching onto the NBN, with slow speeds and frustration around resolving problems. All we get from this lacklustre government and the lacklustre minister is lip-service about these problems. The Australian people have had enough, and increasingly they&apos;re blaming this government for the dysfunction of the NBN.</p><p>Another issue which is really important, particularly in Queensland, is the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements following Tropical Cyclone Debbie. Again, we see the dysfunction of the government. They are not making the adequate contribution to match the state government&apos;s funding of the important recovery projects that we see in Mackay, the Whitsundays and Rockhampton. The mayors are all on side with this. They are the ones calling for the government to come to the party to match the state government funding to ensure these communities can rebuild effectively, but the government have abandoned those communities. Minister Keenan will not even go back and visit those places. It is an absolutely shameful period, where George Christensen, the member for Dawson, has not put his shoulder to the wheel to solve this problem.</p><p>Again, there is an issue that was just discussed at question time today: the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The Leader of the Government in the Senate didn&apos;t even have a brief. This is an important issue that was highlighted in the media—the theft of water with regard to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—and the Leader of the Government in the Senate didn&apos;t even have a brief. That&apos;s how seriously they&apos;re treating the issue. They&apos;re happy to abandon the people who rely on the Murray-Darling Basin as well. But the opposition are going to put a focus on this, hopefully through a Senate inquiry, to get to the bottom of what is going on. At least one party in here will take this seriously.</p><p>So what we have highlighted here is the ongoing dysfunction of this government over section 44, but, more importantly, the negative impact that dysfunction is having on Australian families when it comes to issues like power prices, the NBN and jobs in regional Queensland. It is a disgraceful period for this government. The Australian people deserve so much better than this dysfunctional, self-absorbed government, and the Liberal National Party have a lot to answer for. <i>(Time expired)</i></p><p>Question agreed to.</p> </speech>

<p>Senator Hinch, I respond by making two observations. First of all, Mr Joyce is perfectly entitled to remain where he is until the High Court decides otherwise. He has been declared elected as the member for New England. He has been sworn in as a minister. An issue has arisen because he himself disclosed it in a very forthright way yesterday morning. It is an issue about which over the weekend the government took advice from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Dr Stephen Donaghue, and on the basis of that advice the government is confident of Mr Joyce&apos;s position. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason why he should stand down.</p><p>In relation to the Prime Minister&apos;s observations in the House of Representatives at question time yesterday, Senator Hinch, you rightly and fairly point out that Mr Turnbull himself is a lawyer. He&apos;s a lawyer of some accomplishment. He&apos;s one of the—to the best of my knowledge—three members of this parliament who have actually argued cases before the High Court; his cases include the celebrated <i>Spycatcher</i> case, which he won against a bevy of the greatest legal talent that the British and Australian bars were able to assemble when he was still in his 20s. So Mr Turnbull is no mean lawyer. He has studied—I know, because he and I have discussed it with some care—the Solicitor-General&apos;s opinion. He has studied the precedents, including Sykes v Cleary, the case that bears most immediately upon the point. He&apos;s discussed the matter at length with me. He has very well-informed and well-developed views about section 44 and the jurisprudence surrounding it, and he has formed a view of his own, as I have formed a view of my own. In his case, as in mine, those views have been influenced by the clear advice of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General.</p><p>So it misinterprets the Prime Minister to say that, when he spoke yesterday in the House of Representatives, he was in any way impinging on the role of the High Court or telling the High Court what to do. He was merely expressing his own view about the law—which, as an accomplished lawyer, well acquainted with this area of the law and fortified by the opinion of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, he was perfectly at liberty to do—and making a prediction as to which way he thought the case would go. That is all he was doing, and to suggest he was doing anything more than that is a misinterpretation of what he had to say and, with respect, quite unfair to him.</p><p>Question agreed to.</p> </speech>

<p>The opposition won&apos;t be supporting this motion. This motion misrepresents the recommendation of the Environment and Communications References Committee. It is effectively calling for the Senate to endorse chaotic closure of old coal power stations like those experienced at Northern Power Station in South Australia and Hazelwood in Victoria. More closures are inevitable. By 2035, 70 per cent of Australia&apos;s coal plant fleet will have passed its design life. This is something Alan Finkel recognised in his report when he wrote:</p><p class="italic">A key challenge facing the NEM in the future will be managing the retirement of the existing coal-fired generators as they reach their end of life.</p><p>It also forms the rationale for the three-year closure notice period recommended by the Finkel review and endorsed by this government. The approach advocated by this motion guarantees community and work pain is maximised as are negative impacts on energy affordability and security. Labor stands by its call for closures to be managed in line with the government&apos;s Finkel review. With this motion, those opposite endorse more chaotic closures, larger job losses, higher prices and less secure energy supply. <i>(Time expired)</i></p><p>Question negatived<i>.</i></p> </speech>

<p>The government opposes the motion. The calling into question of a senator&apos;s eligibility to sit in this place is a very serious step, and that step should only be taken in cases where there is a clear case to answer. The motion seeks to turn this long-accepted principle on its head, effectively calling into question every senator&apos;s position until he or she is able to provide conclusive proof of his or her citizenship status. That would constitute a wrong-headed reversal of the onus of proof, especially given the undoubted public interest in certainty for the composition of the parliament. Further, another referral would only add to the existing workloads of Senate committees, and the committee secretariats in particular.</p> </speech>

<p>The opposition will not be supporting this motion. The Senate dealt with, and negated, a very similar motion to this last week. I remind the Senate that when a similar proposal was considered in 1999, Senator Bob Brown, on behalf of the Australian Greens, said:</p><p class="italic">One of the problems is the reversal of the onus of proof. … I am concerned that it could be followed up by a wide variety of motions which require members of parliament to attest to their propriety without there having been any evidence that they had acted with impropriety.</p><p>Labor has taken a consistent approach on similar matters for several years. It reflects the past position of those opposite and the Australian Greens. Labor does not support reversing the onus of proof and requiring all senators to prove their eligibility where no question has arisen. However, where the public record reveals serious credible doubts, the only appropriate resolution is through a referral to the one body that can make an authoritative determination—that is, the High Court of Australia.</p> </speech>

<p>Look, the reason the Greens have put forward this motion for a comprehensive audit of all MPs is precisely because we can&apos;t rely on individual members of parliament coming forward and raising the questions themselves about their eligibility to stand in parliament. If the most recent episode with the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, highlights anything, it highlights that we cannot rely on individuals to fess up. Indeed, it took pressure from some committed journalists within the media, and I do have to pay specific tribute to both Adam Gartrell and Amy Remeikis from the Fairfax papers, who pursued this. It was only after the Deputy Prime Minister was to be outed publicly that he made this acknowledgement. We need to have a comprehensive audit and we need to give some certainty to an issue that is creating great uncertainty in this parliament.</p> </speech>

<p>Australia is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. The government takes a zero-tolerance approach to corruption in all its forms. We have strong laws and a robust multiagency approach to corruption. A range of agencies play a role in preventing, detecting and responding to corruption. A robust multiagency approach is preferable to creating an entirely new agency. The establishment of a national integrity commission would not better guarantee protection against corruption. No single overarching body should be responsible for tackling corruption. By dispersing responsibility, accountability increases.</p> </speech>

<p>The opposition will be opposing this motion. The Senate Select Committee on a National Integrity Commission, which had been working on an inquiry when the last election was called, was re-established this year to inquire into and report on the establishment of a national integrity commission. The committee has held five days of public hearings and received 37 submissions, many quite substantial. The committee was due to report on Tuesday, 15 August, but the reporting date has since been extended to 13 September 2017 and it would be entirely inappropriate to ignore its work by pre-empting its findings and report.</p> </speech>

<p>We&apos;ve just seen Labor and Liberal get together and deny a motion that would allow an independent audit of all members of parliament, and now we see Labor and Liberal get together and refuse to establish a national anticorruption watchdog. Remarkable! We know that anticorruption watchdogs at a state level have uncovered serious corruption and serious wrongdoing and have led to prosecutions. The idea that somehow the federal parliament is immune to corruption is laughable. No wonder people have lost faith in their elected representatives. No wonder they have lost faith in the Labor and Liberal parties. The best disinfectant is sunlight. What we need to do is to make sure we have a strong and robust national body to ensure that not just politicians but figures right across the community—business, the finance industry and so on—have a body able to prosecute— <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>I think Senator Di Natale&apos;s motion here is insulting to a genuine Senate committee. The Select Committee on a National Integrity Commission has had public hearings all the over the country. We have been and talked to the CCC in Queensland—I&apos;m a member of that committee—we&apos;ve talked to IBAC in Melbourne, we&apos;ve talked to ICAC in private meetings in Sydney and we&apos;ve also talked to the AFP here in Canberra. To bring on this motion now makes all the work we have done, with the reporting date coming up, superfluous. I&apos;m not opposed to a national ICAC. I agree with some of Senator Di Natale&apos;s sentiments, but I think this is premature and I will be opposing it.</p> </speech>

<p>It&apos;s quite clear that the Turnbull government has failed Australian families. When we look at the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey we can see that there are growing levels of financial stress and inequality, and we are confronted with a government that either wants to pretend that the issue doesn&apos;t exist or, alternatively, comes up with ideologically-driven and misguided policies to address the issue but which ultimately end up being counterproductive.</p><p>We know that in July this year the Treasurer actually denied that inequality was getting worse. He actually came out and tried to argue the point on that. But we know that if a problem is identified by Labor, it&apos;s as if this government wants to say that night is day and day is night. What they&apos;re doing is applying out-of-touch thinking, and basically coming up with ideologically-driven and counterproductive measures, as I said.</p><p>We know that inequality is a real issue for our country. We only succeed when we succeed together. We won&apos;t see economic growth unless Australians—ordinary Australians—feel confident to spend and invest for the future. I never thought I&apos;d see the day when we had the Reserve Bank of Australia governor coming out and saying that we have record household debt and low wage rises which are hurting the national economy, and calling on workers to demand higher pay rises in order to stimulate the economy. So when we have the Reserve Bank governor coming out and saying that sort of thing, it&apos;s incumbent on our federal government to take note and to try to come up with policies which address these issues.</p><p>We have household debt at the level of 189 per cent of GDP, amongst the highest in the world. So we have a huge issue, but what does the Treasurer say about that? In March of this year, the Treasurer actually said that low wage growth was the Australian economy&apos;s biggest challenge—which was a promising start, and at least on that occasion the Treasurer seemed to grasp that there is a problem with low wage growth. But what does this government do about the issue of low wage growth? Well, it hoes into the earnings of those who are amongst the lowest paid in our workforce. How is that any way to address the issue of low wages growth? Of course, what I&apos;m referring to there is the Fair Work Commission&apos;s decision to cut penalty rates. That decision stands, and at the moment is on track to be inflicted on Australian workers—particularly in the retail and hospitality areas—whilst this government stands idly by, twiddling its thumbs and waiting for something to happen.</p><p>On the other hand, the Labor opposition under Mr Shorten has made our position crystal clear on this. For the benefit of those listening, I think it is always worthwhile reminding people that in the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government, the government will take steps to legislate to restore penalty rates that have been cut under the Fair Work Commission decision. That is a very clear direction; it is a very clear policy measure to overcome the level of stress and inequality that&apos;s being experienced by Australian families.</p><p>On the other side we just see internal squabbling and policy paralysis, which is not good for our country. Australian families deserve to have a government which is focused on them, with laser-like precision. They want a government that is going to care about the pressures that Australian families are feeling. At the moment, the only pressure that the government seems to be responding to is its own internal questions about citizenship and a whole range of other issues which are distracting and not in the interests of getting the problems sorted out.</p><p>The McKell Institute has done a lot of work in relation to the impact of the penalty rates decision, and I want to go to that very quickly. I want to highlight the fact that there are some regional electorates which are worse impacted by the penalty rates cut. Some regional electorates stand to lose up to $21 million in disposable income. Regional and rural economies are subject to losing approximately $289.5 million when, as the McKell Institute says, businesses shift money previously allocated to labour costs within these regions into other jurisdictions. We know that in these regional areas retail and hospitality industries employ close to 20 per cent of the working population. Generally, a higher proportion of the rural and regional workforce is employed in retail and hospitality than the urban workforce. The data seems to suggest that a quarter of a million people will be impacted negatively solely by the Sunday rate cuts. This will concurrently affect the local economies.</p><p>Of course, the resultant lack of spending is hardly good for local communities and their economies, and all the while we&apos;re exacerbating the pressures and stresses that Australians are feeling, particularly in regional areas. One of the parts of Queensland I like to visit as often as I can is the federal electorate of Flynn, which has 2,884 retail workers and 2,458 hospitality workers. That, together with pharmacy and fast food, adds up to 5,800 workers potentially affected by the penalty rates cuts. Total income loss to the community is something of the order of $14 million from the federal electorate of Flynn. This is in an area of Queensland which is already struggling with a range of other factors, and on top of that we have disposable income being ripped out of the local economy. It&apos;s very hard to understand how that can be good for improving the situation of Australian families.</p><p>With the record-low wage growth that I talked about, we know that the government has failed to deliver for Australians. The HILDA Survey shows that median household and annual disposable income has declined for the past few years and reinforces the comments from the RBA governor that I talked about earlier. The survey has highlighted the fact that home ownership is getting out of reach. The survey shows that, for couples with dependent children, home ownership has fallen from 55.5 per cent in 2002 to 38.6 per cent in 2014.</p><p>What&apos;s this government&apos;s response to the issue of home ownership and housing affordability in general? Basically it rejects Labor&apos;s propositions in respect of negative gearing and capital gains tax and has come up with quite a strange policy which taps into superannuation and is entitled the First Home Super Saver Scheme. There is no legislation in place, but it&apos;s already out there. The ATO is sounding a warning to those people who may be contributing to their super accounts to try to take advantage of this scheme. The ATO is saying, &apos;We are unable to comment on policy that is yet to be enacted by the government.&apos; This would appear to be another epic fail in a scheme that not only will not fix the housing affordability crisis but in the process and for good measure will undermine superannuation. We noted that, earlier this year, the Financial Services Council, normally the cheer squad for the government, has come out and made the point that tinkering with superannuation would undermine public confidence in superannuation.</p><p>So there are a range of findings in this report that show that action does need to be taken to address financial stress and inequality. When it comes to incomes, employment outcomes, home ownership, retirement and childcare, this government has failed to deliver. Labor has led the debate in all of these areas. We look after the interests of ordinary people, giving them a fair go with a decent safety net.</p> </speech>

<p>I&apos;m not quite sure that it&apos;s a pleasure to rise to speak on this debate, but I will speak nonetheless, and I thank the proposer of this matter of public importance, Senator Gallagher, for bringing it on. We have another day of debate around demonising those who wish to try and do well and creating a little bit of the politics of envy around what&apos;s happening in this country, while at the same time just blaming the government for all of it. That sounds great in a short speech in a debate that seven people across Australia are listening to, but we really have to get out into reality and check the facts on these things.</p><p>The disappointing thing, though, after listening to Senator Ketter&apos;s contribution and the contributions to the similar debates we&apos;ve had this week and last week, is that nowhere in there is there anything about nurturing aspiration, encouraging growth and trying to get people to try to do things for themselves. It&apos;s all about trying to flatten out society and to create a base—almost a socialist approach to policy—which, I have to say, is very disappointing. These token ideas that are put forward are not going to do what the opposition claim they will. There is this idea of addressing what they&apos;re calling inequality in this nation. What about dealing with things like cost-of-living pressures? What about the equal opportunity to get a job? Instead, if you take the policies of the opposition, they prefer to stifle businesses from investing and stifle them when it comes to growth and employing more Australians to actually contribute to the economy—preventing Australians from trying to put away for their future, invest, save and create a better environment for their own kids as they get older.</p><p>I point to policies in terms of job creation and helping young people get jobs, which is important in regional communities particularly—I think Senator Polley would agree—like the Youth Jobs PaTH Program, which is targeted at helping young people get jobs. It is this novel idea of trying to get people who want to work to work. I think we should be providing that opportunity for everyone. That&apos;s what programs like this are targeted at. They are real programs which will deliver real results and hopefully create employment opportunities for young people.</p><p>No-one in this chamber or anywhere across the country denies that there aren&apos;t people who are doing it tough. That&apos;s not what this is about. Everyone has to acknowledge that there are people who are doing it tough, but to conflate the issue of people doing it tough with the notion that people shouldn&apos;t be doing any better is not the right way to go about it. To suggest that people will only improve their standard of living if we bring down the top end and tax them more heavily is absolutely the wrong approach, in my view.</p><p>The Turnbull government has done a lot when it comes to assisting those in need and providing essential services through things like the NDIS and increased education funding, providing those essential services which will help people—students and those with a disability—to contribute to society. The budget that we brought down earlier this year does that. You have to look at the Tasmanian government as well. After the last three years, under the leadership of Premier Will Hodgman, the state&apos;s now heading in the right direction, with job growth of 10,000 new jobs since the 2014 state election. That&apos;s good news for our state—and I think again that Senator Polley would agree.</p> </speech>

<p>I&apos;ll take that interjection. Senator Polley thinks that 10,000 jobs, in terms of growth, is not good news, which is disappointing to hear.</p><p>But we should be here as a government to assist those who wish to work hard, who wish to contribute to the economy and who wish to see Australia become a better place. Sometimes that requires incentivising growth—people taking risks and people wanting to do better for themselves. I don&apos;t think we should demonise wealth. I don&apos;t think we should demonise people who wish to do a little better for themselves. This is something that I&apos;ve referred to before. There&apos;s no talk from the opposition or indeed from the crossbench—or at least some of the crossbench—when it comes to nurturing aspiration. I&apos;ve not heard one opposition senator talk about the need to encourage young people to want to do better for themselves, to start a business, to invest, to build a home, to employ others and to make sure that when their kids come into the world they&apos;re going to have a better life and should be encouraged to do the same.</p><p>I recently had the good fortune to travel with my wife to visit some relatives in the United States. One thing I noticed was the difference in culture and attitude towards enterprise. The people there want to take a risk and invest their money. The people there desire a better standard of living—a better home and a better car. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing. You don&apos;t see there the envy that gets thrown around the place in Australia, where people say it is bad that a person drives an expensive car or lives in a big house, that they shouldn&apos;t have it because that person over there doesn&apos;t have it. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the right attitude. Instead, I believe we should be encouraging people to aspire to that themselves. In this country we have every opportunity to do that, and we should be encouraging people to do that. I don&apos;t believe wealth creation should be something people are ashamed of, and it&apos;s not something we should be preventing people from doing—in particular, young people.</p><p>I would reiterate that things are going well in terms of opportunities for people to secure employment and save for the future. There were 240,000 jobs created in the last financial year, the largest increase in employment since before the GFC a decade ago. That is great news. So people are going to have the opportunity to get a job, pay their bills and put money away for the future. If you listen to Senator Ketter, and to some of the contributions in similar debates in previous days, it&apos;s all about taxing the top end and clamping down on negative gearing. I&apos;m not sure how many senators and members in this place have multiple investment properties. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing if they do. If over the course of their working lives they have managed to acquire property, to invest, to put something away for their retirement, well done to them. But it sends the wrong message when they come in here and say it&apos;s bad that properties are negatively geared and we have to clamp down on those people who do that.</p><p>The Productivity Commission found in 2015 that 40 per cent of families paid no net tax—once transfer payments such as family tax benefit are taken into account. Contrast that with the top 10 per cent of income earners, who pay almost 50 per cent of the personal income tax received by the Australian government. The top one per cent of individuals pay a staggering 17 per cent of all tax received and the top 0.3 per cent of individuals pay 58 per cent of the capital gains tax. They&apos;re paying a decent amount of government revenue. To me, it looks like they&apos;re doing a fair share of the heavy lifting when it comes to paying tax.</p><p>But Australians know that increasing taxes does not increase wages; as we have said many times over, it stifles growth. So I would call on my colleagues on the other side to alter their thinking on this. Don&apos;t adopt the socialist and, to a degree, communist way and try to prevent people from growing their personal wealth. Look to foster growth and &apos;nurture aspiration&apos;. I look forward to Senator Polley&apos;s contribution on this, to see how many times she talks about &apos;nurturing aspiration&apos; in the state of Tasmania, where young people want to make a go of things and have a better future. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>This is an issue I&apos;ve talked about in this chamber on many occasions. In fact, I chaired a Senate inquiry that found that inequality in this country is getting worse. It distresses me greatly to hear this discussion being juvenilised down to &apos;the politics of envy&apos;. Try telling that to young people who are being locked out of the housing market. In the HILDA survey, if you read the chapter on housing, it&apos;s quite distressing when you look at the impacts the current system is having on young home owners. I know many young people who think they will never be able to afford to buy a house. In this country, not only are we dealing with growing income inequality, we&apos;re also dealing with wealth inequality, and that&apos;s an issue that particularly plays out on young people and those people who are trying to address those issues of inequality, who are trying to find work and who are trying to find accommodation.</p><p>We have a system that favours cashed-up landlords who outbid young people who are trying to buy houses. They keep pushing the price up and up so that young people can&apos;t afford to buy those houses. And that&apos;s because, guess what? Wealth inequality means that the bulk of the wealth, or a large amount of the wealth, is actually owned by a small proportion of people who then lobby government to set the rules. They lobby government really, really hard about not changing negative gearing, about not changing capital gains, about not changing issues around trusts and about not wanting to have banking royal commissions. For example, they use that wealth not just to acquire more wealth, making the community more unequal, but they also use it to lobby government. And then—you guessed it!—government senators come in here and they say, &apos;Oh, that&apos;s the politics of envy!&apos; The fact is that the rules in this country specifically entrench inequality.</p><p>The same government—the politics-of-envy government—who talk about nurturing young people&apos;s endeavour are the ones who also wanted to condemn young people to living on thin air for six months. And then, when they couldn&apos;t get that through this place, they wanted to make them live on thin air for four weeks. They&apos;re the same ones who refuse to acknowledge that income support in this country is too low. In fact, they go out of their way to vilify people who are living below the poverty line on inadequate income support payments—inadequate Newstart payments and inadequate youth allowance payments that further inequality.</p><p>While I&apos;m on this subject, this is why I was greatly distressed on Monday when this chamber voted down our efforts to increase Newstart. I&apos;ve been campaigning in this place for over five years—longer than that—to increase those base rates of Newstart and youth allowance. Five years ago—actually, nearly 5½ years ago—I lived for a short time on Newstart to try to raise awareness of the issues and just to feel what it was like living on Newstart. And we are still campaigning to get an increase.</p><p>We knew then it was below the poverty line. When you get big business and community organisations agreeing that Newstart is too low and that it contributes to people living below the poverty line, you actually must realise that there is a problem. That&apos;s why I was really upset when the Labor Party said that what we&apos;ll have is another review of whether Newstart is actually adequate or not. Actually, that review could be just going out and finding the nearest five or six people who are living on Newstart and asking them whether they think it&apos;s adequate or not, because it&apos;s not! It is not an answer to the issues to just have another review; it&apos;s to commit to Newstart. So, besides coming along where the Greens went on negative gearing, on capital gains tax, on trusts and on the banking royal commission, how about following us down the line of agreeing to increase Newstart and youth allowance? Make a commitment to do one of the quickest things you can do to address the issues of poverty and inequality. We agree! We were out there leading the debate on inequality a long time ago. Agree that one of the ways you can address inequality is to increase Newstart and youth allowance. Then let&apos;s look at what other amendments we need to make—and they are to make some significant changes to our social safety net, to see how we can have a system that addresses the issues of the 21st century. There is no doubt that things need to change. I support this ongoing issue of inequality— <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>Well, this government is at war with the young, from cuts to education funding through to a deliberate attempt to sabotage any meaningful action on climate change. This government shows every time that the only thing it cares about less than young people&apos;s present is their future. The only time that this government shows an interest in young people&apos;s futures is when it cries crocodile tears over the deficit to justify cuts to services.</p><p>The latest HILDA statistics show the toll that this war on the young has had on young Australians&apos; economic prospects. We know that housing is one of the primary drivers of wealth, but young people are being locked out of the housing market. For many young people, the dream of home ownership is just that, a dream. From 2002 to 2014, home ownership for 25- to 29-year-olds dropped by a third. Professor Wilkins from the Melbourne Institute—the one the government likes to talk about—has said that one of the more concerning trends is a growing wealth divide by age group. It is very much connected to what is going on in the housing market. And what has the government proposed to do about it? Absolutely nothing.</p><p>It isn&apos;t just a question of wealth; it has other implications. Young people are being denied the freedoms and life experiences that their parents and their grandparents had. The number of men and women aged 22 to 25 who live with their parents is up: for men by 43 per cent and for women by 27 per cent, since 2001. These are not positive trends in our national life. Young people are earning less, and it is part of the reason that they&apos;re staying at home. Young people are paying more than ever before for their education, yet graduates are less likely to find work when they leave university, and they will be paid less if they do. Real earnings for bachelor-degree graduates declined 16 per cent between 2006 and 2014. Young people who obtain non-university qualifications when they finish school do even worse and young people who do not gain qualifications after school do worst of all.</p><p>I say to Senator Duniam, respectfully, as he waxes lyrical about aspiration and encouraging people to put just a little more away to build something for their future: fine sentiment from government senators is not enough. It is not enough to address the material impacts that policy decisions made by government are having on the young Australians that I know, because the truth is that none of these things are beyond the government&apos;s control. All of these things are being made worse by the government&apos;s inaction. All of them are being made worse by the government&apos;s punitive approach to people who may not be doing quite so well as them, who might not be so comfortable as them and the people that live around them in the leafy suburbs that they represent.</p><p>What have the government offered on wages? They&apos;ve offered penalty rate cuts to young people, and they stood again and again against Labor&apos;s efforts to restore penalty rates to where they were previously. And who is affected? It is young people, who are far more likely to be working in casual roles and working irregular hours. What have they offered to the young unemployed? They have offered the PaTH internships, a completely inadequate and deficient response. Young people need real jobs with fair conditions, not faux internships with unfair wages.</p><p>What have they offered on wealth? They have refused to act on negative gearing and refused to act on capital gains tax, despite every expert in the country telling them it would make a difference. Their super for housing proposal, unbelievably, asks young people to literally mortgage their retirement in order to fund a home. For decades, part of our economic compact has been that each generation can hope to do better than the one that came before it. As the HILDA data demonstrates, young people&apos;s wealth and income are sliding, and they may be forgiven for thinking that the government have forgotten about them. I will say this: Labor hasn&apos;t. When this shambles opposite us finally comes to an end, young people&apos;s future will be a priority, not just a rhetorical debating point.</p> </speech>

<p>I rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted to the Senate by our parliamentary colleague from the ACT Senator Gallagher. Senator Gallagher would like the chamber to consider the growing levels of financial stress and inequality being experienced by Australian families, as revealed by the latest household, income and labour dynamics survey, the HILDA Survey.</p><p>I feel I need to apologise in advance to those who were here yesterday for what may be, potentially, a sense of deja vu, because it was only yesterday that I delivered an eerily similar refutation of Senator Wong&apos;s matter of public importance. My response is similar because, in spite of the opposition&apos;s hectoring, the government position has not changed in 24 hours. This government does indeed take the plight of working families very seriously. But rather than griping or wringing its hands, the Turnbull government is committed to delivering, has delivered and will continue to deliver genuine policy solutions and legislative change to ease the burden on Australian families.</p><p>I find the disingenuous opportunism of the Australian Labor Party on issues of inequality so galling. Senator Gallagher, like Senator Wong before her did yesterday, and countless others are uncritically following their leader&apos;s empty rhetoric on income inequality as an attempt to incite the corrosive politics of envy. In the absence of any substantive policy agenda, the Leader of the Opposition is attempting to use populist bombast to somehow prove the case for his socialist agenda. But the Leader of the Opposition should be warned: do not underestimate the intelligence of the Australian population.</p><p class="italic">Senator Polley interjecting—</p><p>Australians are not fools, Senator Polley. They can see through the opportunism of an opposition desperate to overcome the entrenched personal unpopularity of their leader. The Australian electorate have seen the opposition leader, Mr Shorten, at work: disposing of Prime Minister after Prime Minister and selling out the members of his own union, the very people he was there to protect. The Australian people are far too smart to be duped by this rhetoric, which, quite simply, is a smokescreen for a radical redistribution agenda. Australians, while egalitarian and generous by nature, are naturally suspicious of socialist ideals that demand that, in order for someone to win, someone else must lose. Australians have resisted socialism before, and they will do so again and again and again at the ballot box, over and over.</p><p>Senator Gallagher should know better than to ignore the facts by trying to make the case for an increasingly unequal Australian society and by using statistics she clearly does not understand. While I am loath to use my time in this chamber to go into the dry economics of statistical measures of income inequality, I simply cannot stomach the continued perversion of the truth by those opposite to suit their political agenda. So, please, indulge me for just a moment. Senator Gallagher&apos;s reference to the HILDA Survey refers to a statistical measure called the Gini coefficient. It is a commonly used measure of inequality that ranges from zero to one. Zero means total equality and one means total inequality. So, zero is everyone on the same income and one is the equivalent of one person having all the income. The HILDA survey data shows that the Gini coefficient was 0.303 in 2000-01 and was 0.296 in 2014-15. In other words, it has in fact barely shifted. If anything, it has in fact decreased. So do those opposite fail to understand the information that they regurgitate? Or, instead, do they wilfully deceive the Australian people to serve their political agenda?</p><p>While those opposite are desperately grasping at mendacious opportunities for political advantage, the Turnbull government is actually doing the hard yards of policy development and implementation to deliver household savings to those families who need it most, to shore up the Australian economy for future years and to deliver its intergenerational responsibilities to the Australian families of the future. We have delivered a $2.5 billion investment in early childhood education and care. Almost one million families benefit from that, and low- to middle-income families are the greatest beneficiaries of that package. Only the Turnbull government has actually tackled the rising energy prices head-on by directly dealing with energy retailers. This will ensure that Australian families get a better deal. The Turnbull government is dealing directly with gas suppliers to ensure that Australian businesses and householders come first. And the Turnbull government has repealed the insidious limited merits review regime, introduced under Labor in 2008, that has cost Australian families millions of dollars in excessive energy bills for nearly a decade.</p><p>Finally, the Turnbull government has delivered relief to the small business community in the form of cuts to the corporate tax rates for small and medium-sized entities and maintained the instant asset write-off provisions to encourage investment by those businesses. This is a government that is committed to assisting the small business community to invest in growth, to pay their workers more and to put on more workers.</p><p>This is a government that takes the cost of living pressures seriously and a government committed to delivering for families and small businesses, not to squawking politically motivated slogans intent on emotionally dividing our nation into the haves and the have-nots. Australia remains one of the most wonderfully egalitarian and equal societies in the world. We have one of the most progressive tax systems in the OECD. The economic data has shown a decrease in measures of inequality, and yet the ALP persist with this disingenuous and perverse rhetoric of the politics of envy. While I thank Senator Gallagher for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate, I am content in dismissing it as the mere political stunt it is.</p> </speech>

<p>As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak about reducing the cost of living for Aussie families and battlers because it&apos;s the core of One Nation policies. Most everything we do we hold against this measure: how will this reduce the cost of living for families and battlers? That&apos;s our measure.</p><p>We turn now to today&apos;s MPI, which at its heart talks about cost of living issues. Federal Labor leader Bill Shorten made a speech recently in which he claimed to the ALP faithful that inequality was, &apos;the biggest threat to our health as an economy and our cohesion as a society&apos;. Inequality of wealth is certainly an economic phenomenon that must be considered by policymakers. The left, however, often revert to a view—usually to win an election—that wealth creation is unjust and inequitable. The opposite is the truth. Wealth creation and having sufficient and growing wealth is the sign of a healthy economy, not whether someone else has even more sufficient and growing wealth. Everyone deserves a fair go to make the most of life.</p><p>To put it another way, wealth creation in free markets is inherently win-win, not zero sum. Inequality only makes economic sense as one possible indicator that something may be askew with real net wealth, be it the levels, trend, distribution and, especially, sources of wealth. Real net wealth is not driven by inequality, but by factors such as real income and wages versus the real cost of living. The latter is partially and imperfectly measured by the consumer price index, which nevertheless clearly shows why poor and middle-class Aussies continue to struggle. Price inflation, as measured by the CPI, has been largely and shockingly accumulating like compound interest since the early 1970s.</p><p>Those on the right side of politics—the freedom side of politics—will, or at least should, be aware of the primary role that too many government interventions have in reducing real net wealth and the distribution of wealth. I will say that again: government interventions reduce real net wealth and the distribution of that wealth. Poor government intervention in markets is driving up prices across the economy and putting pressure on the cost of living of those that can least afford it. Key amongst these interventions are regulation, taxation and inflation of the money supply. Such interventions not only always reduce real wealth but always have distribution consequences and inefficiencies as well, whether intended or unintended. Let us remember the famous saying, &apos;The road to hell is paved with good intentions.&apos; Regardless of intentions, most, if not all, government interventions eventually hurt the many to the benefit of the few. The many are the grassroots businesses, consumers, taxpayers and families of this country. The few are the elite lobbyists, activists, bureaucrats and politicians. The poster boy—or is it politically correct nowadays to instead say &apos;poster gender-fluid entity&apos;?—for such interventions is the plethora of climate-related ones since 2007 and the all-too predictable impacts on electricity prices since then. The electricity CPI clearly shows what the story has been in the past decade. The small dip from 2013 to 2015 is the removal of the Gillard Labor-Greens carbon tax. The shocking rise in electricity CPI overall since 2008 has almost exclusively been driven by government regulations and taxpayer subsidies in solar and wind. The energy market, thanks to government regulations, is not an energy market; it&apos;s an energy racket. The problem of CPI is caused by regulation. The solution is not more regulation.</p><p>In conclusion, free-market wealth and thus any inequality are not at the expense of others. Government-facilitated wealth is, has been and always will be at the cost of others. This is where significant and sustainable inequality almost always comes from: fake or crony capitalism, not real free-market capitalism. We at Pauline Hanson&apos;s One Nation Party are the party of cheaper electricity. We at One Nation are the party of a lower cost of living. We need to celebrate human progress, human creativity and that most awesome resource of all, the free human spirit.</p> </speech>

<p>I rise too to make a contribution in this debate. I can&apos;t just let it slide that Senator Duniam, like all of those on that side, was talking about inequality as a &apos;claim&apos;. There couldn&apos;t be anywhere further from the truth, because Australians are feeling the inequality in this country at the moment. To back that up, Senator Hume made comment in relation to the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. You can&apos;t ignore that. You can&apos;t just grab one set of figures out and come into this chamber—although I&apos;d have to say there was a lot more grit in her performance, and she at least delivered her attempt to puff up what the government&apos;s been doing, which was still so far from the truth it&apos;s not funny.</p><p>Senator Duniam was speaking about the youth of Tasmania and what a great job the Liberal state government has been doing in Tasmania. Well, once again, he has misled this chamber, because there have been no signs of any hope. There have been no signs of any jobs for our young people, with the high employment rates we have in my home state.</p><p>We must consider new approaches to tackling inequality and poverty in this country. Unlike those opposite, Labor understands this. We understand this, and we&apos;ve already started with our announcements of policy thus far that will go a long way towards turning around the inequality that this country has developed under this government.</p><p>Those opposite can shrug their shoulders all they like about the facts, but the facts are these: the HILDA Survey shows that child poverty is worsening in single-parent families. That&apos;s a fact. At the same time, childcare costs have doubled; wages growth has flatlined; and levels of homeownership continue to fall. Australian families are bearing the brunt of rising childcare costs, and they are really struggling. The HILDA Survey also shows that the likelihood of child poverty in single-parent families is very high, between 20 and 25 per cent, which is considerably higher than the general community rate of around 10 per cent. That&apos;s a significant difference.</p><p>The government&apos;s complex new work laws and cuts to early-education access will make things even worse for vulnerable children and single parents trying to stay in the workforce, further fuelling the inequality. The Turnbull government has also recently made a $1.4 billion cut to the family tax benefits. By freezing family tax benefit payment rates, the Turnbull government is leaving 1.5 million Australian families and millions of children far worse off. That is not a government which has any understanding of inequality in this country.</p><p>The HILDA figures show that the Turnbull government continues to put investors buying their fourth or fifth property ahead of young people trying to buy their first home. How out of touch can you be? We&apos;ve already laid out our policies in relation to negative gearing. We&apos;ve put those out on the table, and what do we hear from those opposite? They say we&apos;re just trying to play envy politics. Well, it&apos;s not about envy politics. It&apos;s about giving young people and young families the opportunity to have their first home. Those opposite have absolutely no credibility on housing. They claimed in the 2017 budget that they would deliver an extraordinary large housing package and it would be an impressive package and it would be well received. But there is nothing in it. There is nothing in there at all to address the key drivers of housing unaffordability—nothing at all.</p><p>The huge drop in homeownership for people under the age of 40, the declining living standards and flat wages are the headlines. But it is the Turnbull government&apos;s policy response that needs to be highlighted. They are not giving the attention to these issues that they deserve. It is almost like there is this big black hole of lack of policy from that side, and it is just getting bigger and bigger. We know they are distracted with their leadership issues. We know they are distracted by the chaos and the dysfunction within their own caucus. But that isn&apos;t what they were elected to do. They were elected to represent the views and the future of Australian citizens, and they are letting them down. Yesterday we had Senator Macdonald make another of his— <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>The hapless Labor Party have come into this place today, proposing a matter of public importance which highlighted some of the very real difficulties that Australian families are facing. What it allows this Senate to do, and the Australian people to understand, is that the Liberal-National Party government understand these difficulties and we are addressing them, whereas the Australian Labor Party have a recipe to make their difficult circumstances so much worse. That is the distinction that the Australian people face, and I therefore thank the Australian Labor Party for putting this MPI to us today.</p><p>Make no mistake: if the Australian Labor Party had its way, just for example, the cost of building infrastructure in this country would be 30 per cent higher because there would not be the Australian Building and Construction Commission. When you have to pay 30 per cent more for your infrastructure, if it&apos;s public, it is the taxpayer that suffers. If it is private infrastructure, the builder passes that on, or the developer passes that on—to whom? To the people who rent the premises. What do they do? They charge more for the goods and services to the consumer to cover the higher rental. So, each time Mr Shorten defends the CFMEU and says that he will abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, every single Australian should be aware that that is a recipe for increasing their cost of living.</p><p>We move to another issue, which I know many Australians are facing with difficulty, and that is the cost of energy. Which is the state that has the highest domestic power prices in the country—indeed, in the world?</p> </speech>

<p>Senator Ruston, you&apos;ve got it! It is South Australia, because of the manic, ideological approach to renewable energy, an approach that is bankrupting households and small businesses and putting people out of work. And do you know what the Labor recipe for this is? Even more of the same! If Mr Shorten were to become Prime Minister, we would be having a 50 per cent renewable energy target to make the current situation so much worse. What are we doing as a Liberal-National Party government? We are saying affordability and security of supply have to be front and centre of any energy policy. So here again we have the answers, and the Australian Labor Party if given the chance would make the situation worse.</p><p>Or, indeed, we can move to issue of coastal shipping in this country. It is completely out of whack. Coming from Tasmania, I know the cost of coastal shipping; how it prejudices our capacity to export and as a result to grow jobs. Despite that, I&apos;m delighted to report that when a state and federal Liberal government work together in lock step, as we have done in Tasmania since 2013, the unemployment rate can come down from 8.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. Now, that is something that really helps households: giving people jobs. That has been the focus of the Liberal governments, both in Canberra and in Hobart, and that is why Premier Will Hodgman and his government deserve such accolades for the wonderful work they are doing in assisting.</p><p>But, having said that, we understand that a lot more needs to be done, and that is why the Hodgman Liberal government deserves and needs a second term to drive home those benefits. Coastal shipping is costing Bell Bay, an aluminium smelter in Tasmania, an increase in their shipping costs of 63 per cent. So we have Senator Polley, a Labor senator from Tasmania, opining in this place that we&apos;ve got a problem with flat wages. Oh! I wonder why that might be? If you bump up the price of production—be it in coastal shipping; be it in relation to the rorts, rackets and rip-offs in building infrastructure; or be it because of a renewable energy target with energy costs; all these things that Labor inflicts on business—then guess what? There is not the room to provide the wage increases that the Australian Labor Party claim that the workers of Australia deserve.</p><p>Now, let&apos;s be very clear: I would prefer lower energy prices and the capacity for Australian businesses to pay Australian workers more. I would prefer that the cost of infrastructure would be lower so that workers could be paid more. They&apos;re the sorts of things that the Australian Labor Party simply do not understand. But what Labor have now embarked upon is a campaign claiming that they are championing equality. What they are championing is unabashed envy. They want to cut down the tall poppy. They want to say, &apos;If you succeed, we won&apos;t be supporting you.&apos; They want to say to people, &apos;We want equality of outcome.&apos;</p><p>We in the Liberal Party believe in equality, but it&apos;s in equality of opportunity. No matter what task you give somebody, somebody will be the best at it and somebody will be the worst at it. Indeed, even the Australian Labor Party—allegedly, believe it or not—elect a leader, who gets paid a lot more than the backbench. And, allegedly, Mr Shorten is their best! Believe it or not! But that is what the Labor Party are saying to the Australian people. And that is why he gets paid nearly double the salary of the backbencher. Oh! Where&apos;s the equality of that? Have you ever noticed that, when it comes to the Labor Party and trade union officials, the equality issue does not seem to play out?</p><p>But the simple fact is that envy corrodes the being. It poisons the soul of the people who harbour that envy, and that is what the Labor Party are, unfortunately, displaying. And so, when Labor say &apos;equality&apos;, understand that it is cheap, nasty envy—a corrosive attribute. All we have to do is look at countries like North Korea and Venezuela. Everybody&apos;s equal in those countries these days: equal in abject poverty. Venezuela, before Hugo Chavez, was a country of wealth unparalleled in South America. But today it is in abject poverty, courtesy of the failed socialist prescription.</p><p>So in the moments remaining I will just make a few statements that I hope will penetrate the thinking of the Australian Labor Party. But these are truths that are unassailable. They are these: you cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity; what one receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving; the government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else; you cannot multiply wealth by dividing it; and when half the people get the idea they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half get the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation. Look at Venezuela: socialism fails when it runs out of other people&apos;s money. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>I just have to pick up on the comments by the previous speaker on equality of opportunity. Wouldn&apos;t that be lovely? Wouldn&apos;t that be wonderful if all Australians had access to an opportunity of equality? But that&apos;s not the case. It&apos;s certainly not the case for so many of my constituents across the Northern Territory. Opportunity, and access to opportunity, is something we still only dream of. I would say that, when we bring an MPI of such significance to the Senate, we bring it because we are incredibly conscious of the enormous pressures that are growing every day on Australian families. It isn&apos;t about being nasty. It isn&apos;t about being corrosive. This is about reminding those in government and putting them on notice that there are Australians in this country who need you to show leadership, who need you to care. And that&apos;s not what is happening out there. It is definitely not what is happening out there.</p><p>Australia is characterised as having very low rates of poverty and economic segregation and a culture of a fair go. We&apos;ve always been proud of the apparent economic equality in our society, but the Melbourne Institute&apos;s Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey has shown that households are doing it tougher. Before the election of the previous Prime Minister, a typical Australian family took home about what it did in 2009. It now takes home much less. Families are doing it tougher, and people who traditionally could look forward to a future of increasing wealth are now looking at a future of increasing economic uncertainty.</p><p>University graduates earn much less than their predecessors used to—$1,023 a week, down from $1,468—and they are much less likely to be in full-time jobs four years later—73 per cent, down from 91 per cent. Australians with only a high school qualification are doing even worse. When the survey started, 81 per cent were employed full time within four years. Now it&apos;s just 62 per cent.</p><p>More young people are living longer with their parents, and those who are fortunate enough to be able to afford to buy a house are finding it harder to pay off. Let&apos;s not go to the fact that, for constituents in the Northern Territory, the dream of even owning a home is still way off in the distance. Older people are finding it much tougher too, with superannuation amounts failing to meet the expenses of living longer.</p><p>The HILDA Survey shows that child poverty is worsening in single-parent families. At the same time, childcare costs have doubled for many, wages growth has flatlined, and levels of home ownership continue to fall. The survey shows that the likelihood of child poverty in single-parent families is between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, considerably higher than the general community rate of around 10 per cent.</p><p>What the HILDA report has revealed is something that Indigenous Australians have been living with for years—well, forever, really—and that is that the gap is widening: the gap between the haves and the have-nots, the gap between rich and poor and the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. In February this year, the Prime Minister tabled the 2017 <i>Closing the gap</i> report. It showed Australia is failing on six out of seven key measures to boost Indigenous Australia.</p><p>This government is going to spend $122 million on a postal plebiscite on marriage equality. Imagine what programs to close the gap of Indigenous disadvantage this amount of money could fund. The death of the wonderful singer Dr G Yunupingu at the age of just 46 from long-term illness brings home once again the disparity in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Think for a moment of the health services on country that could be funded with $122 million. This government is showing what its priorities are. It&apos;s not about tackling inequality; it&apos;s not about closing the gap; and it&apos;s certainly not about having a vision that will create a stronger and fairer Australia.</p> </speech>

<p>Thank you. I should start by saying that I commend this report to the chamber. This is a very important issue. I would also like to congratulate and say thank you to everyone that gave evidence to this inquiry. This inquiry looks into how people with psychosocial disabilities access the NDIS, but it also talks about how people that aren&apos;t eligible for the NDIS will be able to continue to receive community mental health services and mental health services in general.</p><p>The committee report makes a number of recommendations—in fact, we make 24 recommendations. I really encourage the government, and the NDIA in particular, to look at these. There are some very serious issues raised here. I will point out that this is a consensus report from the committee, and that is very important, because we highlight issues around, for example, the problems with the way the NDIS legislation is operating, particularly for people with psychosocial disabilities. The focus and the parameters around the NDIS are around permanent disability. And that is very important. When we are talking about mental ill-health and psychosocial disabilities, we talk about a recovery model, yet that is not properly dealt with in the NDIS. There was an agreement when the NDIS was established that mental health and psychosocial disabilities would be included. Unfortunately, the recovery model doesn&apos;t quite fit in with the permanency model, so there are some recommendations to look at that in the act.</p><p>The act talks about psychiatric conditions rather than psychosocial disability, so there are also recommendations around the definition. We talk about the way the rules are operating around psychosocial disabilities and make a recommendation to consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of the rules, looking at:</p><ul></ul><ul></ul><p>These are really, really important points. The other issue here is that people with psychosocial disabilities are required to have a diagnosis to receive a package for the NDIS. The problem with that is that everybody else isn&apos;t: for them it&apos;s about functionality of somebody with a disability. So we&apos;re taking two different approaches, and that needs to be addressed.</p><p>The Commonwealth is rolling Partners in Recovery; PHaMs—Personal Helpers and Mentors; Support for Day to Day Living in the Community; and some respite services into the NDIS. We need more funding into the NDIS, but what is happening is that not everybody who is receiving treatment through Partners in Recovery or through PHaMs is eligible for the NDIS. What happens to them? We have a commitment of continuity of support, but if those programs are being rolled into the NDIS, what is going to happen to those people into the future if they&apos;re not eligible for the NDIS? The NDIA has come back and said, &apos;Oh, well, most of the people who are applying who are on PiR are actually getting into the NDIS.&apos; But what we know from the providers, in fact, is that it is only certain people who are coming forward to apply for the NDIS. So when they say most people who are in Partners in Recovery and are applying are in, they&apos;re conveniently forgetting there&apos;s a cohort of people who simply are not applying yet for the NDIS. What will happen to them?</p><p>Also of concern, some providers are telling us, is that providers are being told that if people are applying for PiR or PHaMs, for example, providers can only assess people to include in their programs people who are eligible under the NDIS criteria. In other words, they&apos;re already factoring out people who are mentally unwell and who may need some supports. That means those people are not getting supports, because they&apos;ve already been screened out against the NDIS criteria. When these programs close we will be looking at the cohorts of people and their continuity of support. Will they be going into the NDIS, or into some other programs that the government hasn&apos;t outlined yet? What happens to the people who aren&apos;t on the books yet, people who haven&apos;t yet applied for a program or some support for mental ill health? All those issues need to be addressed. We don’t have any idea about what programs are being rolled into the NDIS from the states and territories. A lot of the states are saying, &apos;We&apos;re putting all our mental health funding into the NDIS.&apos; There will be people who won&apos;t be accessing the NDIS, so they need support.</p><p>The issues around the planning process have been discussed a lot. People who have a psychosocial disability have been phoned—we were told that one was in the supermarket and told: &apos;We&apos;ve got to do your planning process. We&apos;re going to do it now.&apos; It&apos;s ridiculous. Those issues need addressing. Issues around continuity of support urgently need addressing also.</p><p>The other thing we deal with is what we call the old T2 or ILC—information, linkages and capacity building. We urgently need to make sure there is enough funding in there—I for one don&apos;t think that there is. We make recommendations about the need to look at how ILC is going to address issues of the emerging service gaps.</p><p>We also talk about the need to understand the numbers and the cohorts of people. I will finish because I know there is a lot to talk about in this session today. We need to make sure that we have an idea of the numbers of people that we are dealing with—not only in assessment of the programs that are closing and where the service gaps are but also the numbers of people who are accessing a service who will be accessing the NDIS.</p><p>There are a lot of things that we urgently need to do to address psychosocial disability. I urge everyone to look at this report and implement the recommendations. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</p><p>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</p> </speech>

<p>I present the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on Australian veterans, together with the <i>Hansard</i> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</p><p>Ordered that the report be printed.</p><p>I move:</p><p class="italic">That the Senate take note of the report.</p><p>I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in <i>Hansard</i> and make some additional comments.</p><p>Leave granted.</p><p class="italic"> <i>The report tabling statement read as follows—</i></p><p class="italic">I rise as Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to speak to the committee&apos;s report into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel.</p><p class="italic">Before I begin, I wish to acknowledge the service of those current and former members of the Australian Defence Force who have taken their own lives and the sorrow of their families and loved ones. In particular, the committee members and I were saddened to learn about veterans who took their own lives during the inquiry.</p><p class="italic">A unique aspect of this inquiry has been the opportunity to examine the framework of military compensation arrangements and their administration through the issue of suicide by veterans. This focus has highlighted the burden of legislative complexity and administrative hurdles faced by veterans who are often seeking support at a vulnerable period.</p><p class="italic">Some affected veterans characterised their post-service experiences as being the most difficult and challenging period of their lives. Accordingly, the committee has chosen to title its report <i>The Constant Battle </i>which reflects the problematic nature of the issue of suicide by veterans and the on-going challenges in providing them with support.</p><p class="italic">The broad scope of the terms of reference and their interrelated nature has been difficult. An extremely wide range of relevant matters were raised with the committee, particularly in relation to the reasons why Australian veterans are taking their own lives. The committee has been forced to focus its consideration on a limited number of key issues.</p><p class="italic">In the near term, the committee has acknowledged and supported the work of Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs (DVA) in undertaking the reform of its processes through its &apos;Veteran Centric Reform&apos; program and Lighthouse projects. These initiatives are showing results, particularly in reducing the time taken to process claims and the committee has recommended they be funded</p><p class="italic">The BVA will supplement and support the current system of volunteer advocates. Where necessary, the BVA will be allocated a budget to commission legal aid to assist veterans make appeals. The BVA will also take over responsibility for grants to ESOs regarding advocacy, training and accreditation of volunteer advocates and insurance issues.</p><p class="italic">Finally, the burden of legislative complexity and impact of administrative hurdles on veterans were the primary issues of the inquiry. It has been a number of years since there was a large scale review of the system as a whole. There was broad support for a wide-ranging review of the legislative framework and administrative delivery of support for veterans with an emphasis on simplification and improving client experience. While steps are being taken by DVA to streamline some aspects of their processes, the committee considers that simplifying the legislative framework and administrative process should be the key objective of future reform.</p><p class="italic">Given the complexity of the current arrangements, any systemic review will be extremely challenging. It will require a public research organisation with established research and analysis capabilities. It should also be able to conduct its review largely independent of Defence and DVA. The committee considers that the Productivity Commission is the best placed to undertake this large-scale review. In particular, this review should examine use of the Statements of Principle which are used in determining compensation claims. The review should be completed within 18 months and be tabled in the Parliament.</p><p class="italic">During the committee&apos;s inquiry there have been major developments in relation to several issues including suicide prevention programs, the legislative framework in the Veterans&apos; Affairs portfolio and the administration of claims by DVA. This was underlined by the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Veterans&apos; Affairs, the Hon Dan Tehan MP.</p><p class="italic">The committee&apos;s report acknowledges the substantial support being committed by the government to veterans and undertaken by DVA to improve services for veterans. It is encouraging that DVA&apos;s reform agenda appears to be moving in the same direction as the recommendations suggested by many submitters. Nevertheless, it is clear that, the pace of reform has been slow and needs to be increased.</p><p class="italic">Using new research about veterans, including findings which will arise from the Transition and Wellbeing Research Program, will be important in guiding support. In this context, the committee has recommended a two-track transition process be established with intensive support for veterans who are identified as likely to need it. Further, the committee has recommended all transitioning ADF members should be provided with a DVA White Card to facilitate access to non-liability health care, serve as veteran identification and to serve as a platform for data collection.</p><p class="italic">Many of the veterans the committee spoke to felt that alternative therapies had significantly improve their conditions. While the evidence base for these alternative therapies is still developing, the committee has recommended the Veterans and Community Grants program be expanded to support the provision of alternative therapies to veterans with mental health conditions.</p><p class="italic">There also is value in developing an evidence base for alternative therapies to assist veterans in Australia. The committee has recommended funding for a trial program that would provide assistance animals for veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) stemming from their military service in order to gather research.</p><p class="italic">The committee&apos;s understanding was assisted by the recent research undertaken by the AIHW into the incidence of suicide by ADF members and veterans. There was strong support expressed for an on-going national register to track this problem and to develop a better understanding of it. The committee has recommended a National Veteran Suicide Register be established and maintained by the AIHW.</p><p class="italic">A key contention during the inquiry was that the DVA claims process are a major stressor on veterans and could even act as a contributing factor to suicide. To gain a better understanding of this issue, the committee has recommended an independent study be commissioned into the mental health impacts of the claims processes on veterans with the results to feed into future administrative reform.</p><p>I wanted to make some brief additional comments in respect of this extremely important bipartisan report. The first thing I wanted to put on the record is the contribution of the deputy chair, Senator Back. Senator Back, as always in all of his work in this Senate, was extremely involved, competent, diligent and proactive with respect to what has been quite a long-running and, in some cases, distressing inquiry. So the first thing is that the contribution of Senator Back was, as always, above and beyond exemplary. Also, I would like to highlight the bipartisan nature with which this inquiry was able to conduct itself.</p><p>There were 420-odd submissions. I might say at this point that we&apos;re resourced in this parliament with quite extraordinary public servants. There is no doubt that, in the brief time that I have been in this parliament, I have had the excellent service and resource of quite extraordinary public servants. In this particular inquiry, our lead officer, Mr Owen Griffiths, has been absolutely extraordinary. I personally couldn&apos;t read all of the submissions that came in to our inquiry and still cope, because they are extremely distressing. Some of the private and confidential submissions—you can&apos;t read them without it affecting you. Mr Griffiths has had to go through all of those submissions. He&apos;s had to maintain the complete professionalism and discipline that is so evident in the Senate&apos;s exemplary staff and produce an outstanding, high-quality, bipartisan report. I think that simply needs to go on the record.</p><p>We won&apos;t please everybody with this report, but we have at least kept the parliamentary participants all on the one page, so to speak. The department has had some useful pointers on how to improve its performance, but I also think it is really important to put on the record that it is one of the oldest public sector departments and has a myriad of legislation which binds its activities. That hasn&apos;t made it easy. It hasn&apos;t made it easy for those public servants in that place. But we&apos;ve gone through it all very diligently and methodically, I think, and pointed out some very useful areas where we can perhaps make some inroads into what is the constant battle. That is the title of this report, and suicide by veterans is by its very nature a constant battle. We won&apos;t solve it, but we believe that we&apos;ve got a bipartisan approach and some pointers in the right direction. I will conclude at that point.</p> </speech>

<p>In my role as Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee I would also like to attach my comments to the chair of this particular inquiry, Senator Gallacher, and his tabled comments and to reiterate his support for the very strong bipartisan approach that both the former chair, Senator Back, and he took to this complex and quite intricate issue of suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. This inquiry received an overwhelming response and really goes to why this issue requires such a bipartisan approach from both sides of parliament and, indeed, from the crossbench with their strong advocacy for our veterans in that area.</p><p>Eight Australians take their lives every day, and suicide is the greatest cause of death for men and women aged between 14 and 44. Sadly, the challenges posed by the transition to postservice life and the inability to cope with these challenges on their own—often there is shame and embarrassment even to ask for assistance from loved ones—has meant that veterans and ex-service personnel have traditionally been overrepresented in these suicide statistics. Just over a year ago, anyone with a mental health condition who served a single day in the Australian Defence Force had to prove that it was linked to their service before they were eligible to access support from the department. In response, the government has already introduced free and immediate treatment for any mental health condition suffered by ex-service personnel.</p><p>The government is aware of this issue. We&apos;ve been working tirelessly to address it, as Senator Gallacher has stated. This is very old legislation. There is a lot to unpack. This report will go a long way to assisting both our government and future governments with addressing this concern. But we stand united in this place and as a Senate committee in our desire to assist our ex-servicemen and our veterans to ensure that they have optimum mental health and that we reduce the statistics as a matter of urgency.</p><p>I&apos;d like to thank the secretariat and former Senator Back, who led this charge on behalf of the government in that committee. Thank you.</p> </speech>

<p>I rise to pass on some bleak, sad and tragic news about the reality of life in Australia for a lot of our veterans these days. On average, a veteran is lost to suicide every four days in this country. 57 of them have taken their lives so far this year. Mark Johnston, my friend who heads up the Australian National Veteran Arts Museum, is here in the gallery today. I acknowledge him. He knew many of them. He also knows many others who are at risk right now.</p><p>Thankfully—and thank you, Senator Lambie—there are now some great organisations out there supporting our veterans. Museums and cultural institutions do play an important role in creating a sense of identity, a sense of worth, some purpose and some hope for these men and women in our communities and also individually. Remember: Weary Dunlop once said, &apos;Give the men in hospital access to the arts and crafts so they may have an interest in life.&apos; In the 1930s, they built at 310 St Kilda Road a repat hospital for World War I veterans—and then it was used for World War II veterans—where Weary Dunlop took care of patients. That&apos;s the building where we hope and plan for ANVAM to be. It&apos;s been owned by the Department of Defence and has been empty for 20 years, and it will be the new home of ANVAM. It will validate the service and promote creativity. We&apos;re working with the War Memorial to provide a social gathering place. It will include all those who are suffering emotional turmoil. And it&apos;s in the arts centre footprint, as they call it, near the shrine, almost opposite the wonderful bronze statue of Weary Dunlop with one touch of red, which is the red poppy in Weary Dunlop&apos;s lapel.</p><p>Tonight I want to thank the Victorian government and especially the Treasurer, Tim Pallas, for working closely with us to give this museum a home in our beautiful St Kilda Road opposite the shrine. I also want to thank the federal government and the Victorian state government for their commitment to this project, because their commitment to the project has touched many people in the veterans community. They can&apos;t wait to have that museum space to call their own. I walked through it recently—admittedly with a safety mask because there was asbestos and God knows what in there—and it is going to be a magic place for the veterans in Australia.</p><p>Just one more point I want to make quickly is that on Anzac Day this year we had a display of veterans&apos; art in an art gallery in Collins Street. I looked at some of the beautiful artworks there and I said to the guys, &apos;What are you going to do with your artwork while we try to get this museum open?&apos; And they said, &apos;We&apos;ll probably stack them away in packing boxes.&apos; I said, &apos;Give me a couple of them—they&apos;ll be on display in my office.&apos; And two, by veterans Michael Williams and Sean Burton, are on display in the foyer of my office here. I invite all senators—all my colleagues—to come and have a look at them.</p> </speech>

<p>I would like to pay tribute to the remarks made by Senator Gallacher, Senator McKenzie and Senator Hinch in relation to this report, <i>The constant battle</i><i>: suicide by veterans</i>. Often people only see the conflict that goes on during question time, and perhaps during estimates. But I can assure them that the bipartisanship—in fact, more than bipartisanship—displayed by this committee working on this issue was exemplary. So I would also like to pay tribute to Senator Lambie and Senator Kakoschke-Moore.</p><p>I would like to acknowledge the service of former ADF members who have taken their own lives and the sorrow of their families. I wish to give special acknowledgement to those who have lost family members to suicide during the course of the inquiry.</p><p>The burden of responsibility to do justice to those ex-service personnel who have been lost to suicide has been keenly felt by all members of the committee. We don&apos;t have exact figures for the number of suicides and attempted suicides among former ADF members, but a recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study found that between 2001 and 2015 there were 325 certified suicides amongst ADF veterans. But the real figure may well be higher. The reason that it is sometimes difficult to know these statistics exactly is that some veterans become very isolated, and in fact it is not known by their comrades that they have committed suicide. This was evidence that was tendered during the committee inquiry.</p><p>The suicide rate among veterans who have seen operational service does not seem to be significantly higher than the rate among other veterans, and this would suggest that the common stereotype of veteran suicide resulting from the trauma of combat needs to be treated with caution. Post-traumatic stress is obviously a factor in some suicides amongst former ADF members, but it is far from being the sole cause. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study found that the group most at risk were young veterans involuntarily discharged due to physical or mental injury. This group exhibited suicide rates double that of the comparable national population and this suggests that our attention needs to be focused on the transition from service to civilian life, particularly among young men who have been involuntarily discharged for whatever reason. These men may suffer from a variety of psychological factors that may well then dispose them to suicide. We must never forget of course that behind every statistic there is a human story, and often a tragic and heartbreaking one. Of course, this is not only a tragedy that affects veterans and the Defence community but also their families and friends. Indeed, we are all affected.</p><p>For our veterans and ex-service personnel who are frequently required to spend an extremely long and difficult time on deployment, it is clear that the return to civilian life is not a simple proposition. The experiences of active duty can leave an indelible mark on some of our veterans. But I think that it&apos;s important that we not see our ADF veterans as victims. The vast majority of former ADF members, all of whom are volunteers, are justly proud of their military service and we are proud of them. They have made successful transitions to productive roles in Australian society and rightly believe that military service has contributed to their growth as humans and to their postservice roles.</p><p>It would be a mistake to accept the common stereotype that the trauma of operational service always leads to psychological difficulties, let alone to suicide. In fact, a senator from another place, US Senator John McCain, says in his memoir, <i>Faith of My Fathers</i>, that he often feels that he&apos;s most comfortable amongst those men with whom he served; those friendships that were formed and the support that they gave to each other while he was on service in the US Navy—particularly those he spent &apos;time&apos; with, if I can put it that way, in the &apos;Hanoi Hilton&apos;.</p><p>The key finding of this report is not that a disproportionate number of ADF veterans are at risk of suicide; it is that we currently have an inadequate infrastructure of support for those who are at risk. An accurate assessment of the impact of military service on the mental health of our veterans and the provision of appropriate services for them is a pressing issue. It is something that we need to address, and now. The report shows that we can do a much better job of fulfilling our responsibilities to our veterans. Every suicide among former ADF members, whatever its cause, is a reminder of our obligation to protect those who have protected us.</p><p>The committee heard about the sense of futility that faces some veterans upon being discharged. We heard about the trauma that can arise from living and working in a war zone. Perhaps most tellingly, we heard about the sense of abandonment felt by some veterans and their families upon their return. We heard veterans characterise their postservice life as being the most difficult and challenging period of their lives. We heard from Jason Burgess, who spent a combined total of 14 years in the ADF and was deployed twice to Timor and once to Iraq. Upon his return from Iraq, he attempted twice to take his life. He said to the committee:</p><p class="italic">To be told that you will never be able to work again due to your physical or mental illness, and then to have your pay cut, and so to not be able to afford to support yourself or your family, is enough to break people, and will lead them to suicide.</p><p>We also heard from a widow, Bonny Perry, whose husband took his own life, and we heard of her sense of frustration as she spoke of her husband&apos;s seven previous suicide attempts.</p><p>Mental health treatment is now available free of charge to all veterans and ex-service personnel, unlimited by budget. The Commonwealth has allocated $192 million over the next four years in addition to the $187 million DVA spends each year providing mental health support to veterans and their families. The committee&apos;s report presents a number of recommendations which we hope will go some way to addressing the current shortfalls in the system.</p><p>In the short term, we recommend that the government continue to support and fund the Veteran Centric Reform program in DVA. Much of the evidence that we heard over the course of the inquiry was related to veterans&apos; experiences with DVA. We were saddened to hear veterans say that they would rather fight the Taliban than DVA. Our recommendations concern the streamlining of administration in the DVA, reducing the backlog of clients, and increasing the capability and training of staff at DVA to deal with mental health conditions and complex health concerns. Our recommendations also address the need to improve engagement with younger veterans.</p><p>Other short-term recommendations include targeted programs addressing issues in the transition of veterans to civilian life, and more appropriate interactions with both mental health service providers and alternative therapies for veterans with mental health conditions, including some very compelling reasoning around the benefit that therapy animals bring. I would like to pay tribute to the organisation Ruff Love Assistance Dogs, who came to the Brisbane hearings earlier this year with their very beautiful dogs and whom it is impossible to forget. We also recommend that all transitioning ADF members should be provided with a DVA white card to facilitate access to non-liability health care, to provide identification as a veteran and to aid in data collection.</p><p>In the medium term, we recommend that a national veteran suicide register be established and that the government commission an independent study into the mental health impact of the claims process. We also make some recommendations about the transition to civilian life, and we recommend supporting the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to create and maintain a public database of support services. In the longer term, we believe and recommended that a review by the Productivity Commission, which may look at simplifying the system, would be advisable.</p><p>The committee has also recognised the substantial support that the Australian government has shown for the reform of the DVA and legislative frameworks to improve the experience of veterans. But it&apos;s evident that there are significant improvements that must be made to the system before we can really aspire to address the problem of suicide among our ex-service personnel.</p><p>I am reminded once again of how fortunate we are to have the Australian Defence Force, and I am reminded especially in this week, when I am participating in the ADF Parliamentary Program and am hosting an intern. I would like to thank him and the organisers of that program. It&apos;s a privilege afforded to parliamentarians to have these opportunities. So I would like to say thank you, and I commend this report to the Senate.</p> </speech>

<p>After almost a year of consideration by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee with five public hearings across the nation and over 450 submissions, the report on veterans suicide named, <i>The constant battle: suicide by veterans</i><i>,</i> has been tabled. It is 191 pages in total and comprehensive. Part of this report addresses short-term problems which include streamlining, administration, staff training at the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs and improving engagement. It calls on targeted programs based on new research, increasing the understanding of the mental health community and addresses support issues of transition from military life into civilian life and the need for access to alternative therapies.</p><p>In the medium term, the committee found that there was clear evidence for a national suicide register. It noted concerns about negative interactions with the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs and that the claims process is the key stressor and contributing factor to suicide by some veterans. It noted issues with medico-legal firms retained by the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs to assess veterans. The committee has recommended the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs reassess medico-legal firms.</p><p>It has recommended that the carer assistance scheme include an option for veterans to undertake a period of work experience with an outside employer, and that the Australian Public Service Commission conduct a review to support veterans employment into the APS. Noting the complex range of services available to veterans, the committee recommended funding support of the veterans and veterans&apos; families counselling services to create and maintain a public database of services which would provide an information service to assist veterans and their families.</p><p>The committee also recommends a review of the practice which prohibits lawyers appearing for veterans before the Veterans&apos; Review Board. Longer term, it noted that addressing the legal and administrative complexities of veterans entitlements is long overdue. It has recommended a Productivity Commission review into the legislative and administrative processes, including an examination of the utilisation of the statements of principles with the objective of simplifying the entitlements system. It has recommended that this review be completed within 18 months, and the establishment of a bureau of veterans advocates. This bureau of advocates would be modelled from the Canadian system—that being the Bureau of Pensions Advocates—which has proven to be a success. I suggest that we have bipartisan support and that we do not wait 18 months to set that up. I will probably look at that tomorrow.</p><p>The Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs can no longer hold on to the status quo nor justify incremental changes done in the past. Previous reviews of military compensation and the piecemeal approach of reforms have contributed to the overall complexities of veterans&apos; entitlements in our country. It is now time for a complete overhaul of the compensation and rehabilitation system in this country.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Auditor-General, through the Australian National Audit Office, indicated it would conduct a potential performance audit into the efficiency of veterans&apos; service delivery by the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs in its annual audit work program for 2017-18. As such, the committee recommends the audit be conducted as a matter of urgency. This audit will serve to complement and reinforce the work of administrative review by the Productivity Commission.</p><p>Given the context of this report and its recommendations, I am now calling on all veterans—young, middle-aged, old, enlisted and officers—to unite and put pressure on the Turnbull government to adopt and implement these recommendations as soon as possible. Over the last several years, the ex-service organisations of our nation and the veterans&apos; community have been greatly divided on a host of issues. It is now time for healing. Veterans need to stop bashing veterans who are helping veterans. Stopping veteran suicides and attempted suicides is paramount. To be able to achieve this, we will all need to work together.</p><p>Where there are areas that veterans disagree on, we need to be able to agree to disagree. Where we find common ground, we all need to stand together as one. I&apos;m calling on all retired Australian Defence Force senior non-commissioned and retired commissioned officers to take the lead and be the leaders that they once were when they served in uniform. Your nation needs you, once again, now more than ever as role models in the veteran community. Be the leaders who are healers where veterans are fighting and backstabbing other veterans. You need to call that out as leaders and show others a more constructive way of addressing issues and moving forward.</p><p>The time of a divided veterans&apos; community needs to cease immediately if we are going to achieve tangible action on the recommendations of the committee&apos;s report. United we stand to demand the government takes action; divided we will continue to fall, with the status quo remaining. The veterans&apos; community as a whole bears some responsibility here, because it has been so divided. All ex-service organisations, veterans and their families must band together to demand that the government of today implement these recommendations. Where the government decides to disagree with a committee recommendation, it should not be able to disagree without having a workable alternative to that recommendation.</p><p>We need a united front and sustained pressure to deny the government the space to wriggle out of its responsibilities to veterans once and for all. It is only with a united veteran community that we will be able to hold the government of the day, as well as future governments, accountable and ensure that the recommendations are adopted and implemented as quickly as possible. It is for this reason that all veterans and their families must stand together as one. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</p><p>Leave granted.</p> </speech>

<p>This is a very useful report with a number of very useful recommendations, and the government will, no doubt, look at them and respond in due course. I congratulate the chairman, Senator Gallacher, and deputy chairman, Senator McKenzie. I also pay tribute to former senator Chris Back, who played a very big part in this inquiry and the report.</p><p>While the report does have a lot of useful information, the government has already worked very significantly on addressing the welfare of veterans. This has been going on for quite some time now under the Turnbull government. Indeed, in the last budget there were a significant number of new initiatives to address many of the matters that were raised before this committee.</p><p>I remind the Senate that the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs currently supports about 291,000 Australians. Just over half of these people are veterans or currently serving members of the ADF. Around 48 per cent of them are women. Around 82,000 are widows or widowers, and I&apos;m aware of that because my sister is one of those who receives wonderful treatment from the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs. There are around 2,500 children of veterans who are also supported. Interestingly, about $6.2 billion, or 54 per cent of the department&apos;s budget, will be spent on providing for veterans and their families with income support and compensation. About $5 billion, or 44 per cent of the department&apos;s budget, will be spent on meeting the healthcare needs of veterans and their families. And around 0.8 per cent of the department&apos;s budget is spent on commemorations and maintaining memorials and headstones. So it&apos;s a significant contribution by the Australian taxpayers, through the Australian government, to support people who have done so much for this country over years past.</p><p>We all know that one suicide in Australia is one too many. Suicide affects all areas of our community. Eight Australians a day take their own life, sadly and regrettably, and it remains the greatest cause of death for men between the ages of 14 and 44. Sadly, our veterans and members of the ADF are not immune from those statistics. The government&apos;s determined to address suicide in our community, and we all have a role to play. We&apos;re committed to serving all Defence personnel, veterans and their families. We have introduced free and immediate treatment for all mental health conditions for any veteran with one day&apos;s full-time service. The government has held the first Female Veterans and Families Forum. We&apos;re committed to the Prime Minister&apos;s veterans&apos; employment initiative to find out how we can ensure that employers know the benefits of hiring a veteran. We&apos;ve committed the largest investment in the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs systems and processes to cut the wait times and make their services more focused on veterans. I know this figured prominently in the committee&apos;s report. As a government, we have initiated and hosted the first meeting of state and territory veterans&apos; ministers to provide input on how we can work together across all levels of government on issues such as veterans&apos; homelessness.</p><p>Just a few days ago, the minister provided in a statement a confirmation of the government&apos;s commitment to a standalone Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs—a department that focuses on needs of veterans first and a stronger voice for the veterans&apos; community. The first one I mentioned is the standalone Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs. Unfortunately, with social media there are a lot of furphies and mistruths and a lot of misinformation that go around, particularly amongst the veterans&apos; community. This is unfortunate because they upset, needlessly, many veterans who naturally believe some of the rubbish that goes around on social media because they are sourced in a way that looks valid. But any early inquiry will show that they are completely fake, so to say. One going around last week was that the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs was going to be abolished and that the Department of Human Services was going to take over the role. I know that a lot of constituents of mine were concerned when they read this rubbish, and I was only too pleased to be able to confirm that it was nothing more than fake news. But it is unfortunate that that does permeate the social media because it does worry, needlessly, a lot of our veterans.</p><p>I just want to briefly mention again some of the support the government is giving. A lot of this has been referred to in the committee&apos;s report and a lot of it is already happening. Senators will know that the Turnbull government invested an additional $350 million in this year&apos;s budget to support veterans. There were focuses on two strong issues: mental health support, which we&apos;ve been discussing; and reform of the department&apos;s processes and systems, which we&apos;ve also been discussing in this debate and which the committee made reference to.</p><p>We are expanding the program of free and immediate—I stress &apos;immediate&apos;—mental health support to current and former ADF members. This treatment is currently available for five specified mental health conditions. The government is expanding our Non-Liability Health Care Program so that it will be available for any mental health condition, including phobias, adjustment disorders and bipolar disorders. Just 12 months ago, anyone who had served one day as a full time Australian Defence Force member had to prove that any mental health condition was linked to their service. After suffering these conditions, they would have to wait to have their eligibility and claim approved by the department. The wait times would see their mental health deteriorate or they would not receive the support that they desperately needed. So last year, the government provided a new approach of free and immediate treatment for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse and substance abuse without the need to prove the condition was service related. In this budget, the government has gone further. We now commit to provide this for all mental health conditions. It will mean that from now on veterans and defence personnel can get free and immediate treatment without a burden of proof and without the need for a bureaucratic barrier. Most importantly, this policy is completely uncapped, so whatever the demand it will be funded from somewhere in government. The government is also expanding eligibility for the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service, which we think is a very important service that does, in fact, save lives. I return to what I was speaking about before: that suicide prevention is a complex issue and, as reports have shown, there&apos;s no simple solution. It requires a multifaceted response, and we have provided about $10 million to pilot new approaches to suicide prevention and to improve the care and support available to veterans. This is a useful report, and I have no doubt that the government will appreciate the recommendations and the thought and effort put into it. I do want to emphasise that the government is well aware of them, and that many of the issues that were spoken about in the inquiry are already being dealt with by the government with considerable extra funding and rearrangements in the department taking place.</p> </speech>

<p>I won&apos;t detain the Senate much longer on this particular report, because I know that there are other matters to come, but I would like to contribute a few remarks. I commend this report to the chamber.</p><p>We heard from a large number of veterans and a large number of experts in this area who gave us, at times, shocking evidence. Some of the numbers and facts were very confronting for a number of people. I would very, very strongly suggest and beg the government to look at these recommendations. I&apos;ve just listened to the contribution from Senator Macdonald, and, yes, the committee is aware of the announcements that the government has made, but there are still significant things that need to be done. I think we made 19 recommendations—we added a few at the end, so I must admit I lost count of the final number but I think I&apos;m right in saying 19. They cover a wide range of issues that urgently need to be addressed. We have a significant problem in this country, and the recommendations, I believe—and I&apos;m sure those on the committee do to—will address it. It is absolutely imperative that the issues that were brought up in our report, in full knowledge of all of the other work that&apos;s going on, need to be addressed. If anybody doubts that we have a problem, I urge them to read the report or, better still—because we can&apos;t put everything into the report—read the hundreds of submissions that we received and also look at the transcripts from the hearings. Then people will understand why it&apos;s so important that we look at these recommendations.</p><p>I strongly support this report. It was, I&apos;ve got to say, quite harrowing sometimes listening to the evidence. If we feel that, imagine what veterans are feeling right now living on a day-to-day basis without adequate supports and still with problems in the way that things are handled, including with the department. I think we owe it to our veterans to make sure that every one of these recommendations is given very close attention. I commend the report to the chamber, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</p><p>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</p> </speech>

<p>by leave—On behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, I table a ministerial statement on the conclusion of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. I move:</p><p class="italic">That the Senate take note of the statement.</p><p>I&apos;m very pleased that this statement was made yesterday during the guest of government visit by the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, the Hon. Manasseh Sogavare MP. In particular, it gives me great pride and satisfaction to note that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, or RAMSI as it was known, concluded its mission on 30 June this year. Operation Helpem Fren ended after 14 years of Australian-led support. Australia, through governments on both sides of politics, provided the leadership and a substantial share of the human and financial resources that initiated, powered and sustained this critical and highly regarded regional intervention. It was essentially a civilian-led policing operation intended to re-establish law and order and implement the necessary governance and economic reforms to provide the Solomon Islands with a firm foundation on which to build its future security and prosperity. This was reinforced by the Solomon Islands domestic enabling legislation. RAMSI was also endorsed by the Pacific Islands Forum, so the legal foundation for its presence in the Solomon Islands was therefore very strong.</p><p>From 1998 to 2003 the Solomon Islands was being pulled apart by lawlessness, violence and rampant criminality. The causes were complex, but ethnic and provincial tensions and relocation were at the core of the conflict. By July 2003 the Solomon Islands was well on the way to becoming a failed state. Its economy had ceased to function. The state was no longer providing even the most basic of services, including water and electricity, and basic law and order had broken down. Children were not going to school and were often press-ganged into the service of marauding militants. These same militias were literally holding the government to ransom, extorting money from the state&apos;s near-empty coffers.</p><p>So in July 2003, after much deliberation, the Howard government made the decision to help the Solomon Islands government bring the country back from the precipice. The Howard government well understood that the ills which were plaguing the Solomon Islands could quickly spread throughout the region. While RAMSI was led by Australia, its success lay in the fact that it was a genuinely regional initiative, having been established under a treaty to which all 15 contributing Pacific Island countries, including New Zealand and Australia, were parties. Our Pacific neighbours collectively contributed thousands of police, military, diplomatic and advisory personnel to the mission. It has set an important precedent and provides us with a model for future regional collaboration. RAMSI was particularly successful in achieving its immediate priority of re-establishing law and order. In the first week, more than 3,700 guns were collected and destroyed. In its third week, the surrender of renegade militants was negotiated with the help of mediators. By the end of the third year, 6,300 arrests had been made for militant and criminal activity.</p><p>In 2017 Solomon Islands presents a very different picture. Whilst islanders today face many unresolved challenges, life has long since returned to relative normality. I&apos;ve had the privilege of visiting the Solomon Islands four times in my role as Minister for International Development and the Pacific. I have seen the national health services helping to distribute medicines in the outer provinces, I&apos;ve seen the infrastructure developments—the roads, bridges and wharves, which provide the lifeblood of economic growth. I have seen how the women of the Solomon Islands are working together to promote private enterprise, advocate for better services and combat domestic violence. I&apos;ve seen how Australian aid dollars are supporting these good works. The Solomon Islands is reaping the benefits of stability, with the economy having grown more than 80 per cent in the first 10 years of RAMSI. Underpinning this growth is an effective, functioning and rehabilitated police force, of which about one-third are women, which has not only been remoulded to once again provide the nation&apos;s front line of security but has also delivered training to other police forces in the Pacific and is now contributing to UN peacekeeping in Sudan.</p><p>All of this came at a cost. More importantly, I want to acknowledge the human cost. Six RAMSI officers lost their lives over its term, including four Australians: Private Jamie Clark, 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, ADF; Adam Dunning, Protective Service Officer, Australian Federal Police; Ronald Lewis, Protective Service Officer, Australian Federal Police; and Tony Scriva, a civilian adviser to the Solomon Islands government. They will always be remembered for their sacrifice. Australia invested approximately $2.8 billion of the $3 billion cost over the 14 years of the operation. And the cost to Australia, financial and otherwise, would have been far greater had we not acted when we did.</p><p>Now it is imperative that the gains from RAMSI be preserved. Prime Minister Sogavare understands better than anyone the importance and complexities of the challenges which lie ahead, and he has dedicated himself and his government to tackling them head on. But the Solomon Islands will not do it alone, and Prime Minister Sogavare has our full support. In June this year, on behalf of the Australian government, I signed a three-year aid partnership agreement between our two countries which establishes our shared vision for cooperation to foster inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and stability in the Solomon Islands.</p><p>Ultimately, however, to achieve these goals the Solomon Islands government will need to maintain law and order and stability for a sustained period. To this end, Australia and the Solomon Islands have worked to develop a package of assistance to consolidate bilaterally the work that RAMSI has up to now driven. This includes a policing program under which we have placed 44 AFP advisers in Honiara to mentor, train and advise the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. This will be complemented by new bilateral programs of support for justice and governance. This package will amount to $141 million over four years, from 2017 to 2021. This is part of our overseas development assistance to the Solomon Islands, which in 2017-18 will be $142.2 million. On Monday, our governments also signed a bilateral security treaty, the first of its kind in the Pacific. The treaty will enable Australian Defence Force, police and civilian personnel to deploy operationally in emergency situations to provide security or humanitarian assistance at the Solomon Islands government&apos;s request.</p><p>Regional security cooperation in the Solomons did not begin with RAMSI. Last week, I had the honour and privilege to represent Australia at the commemorations in Honiara marking the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Guadalcanal, including the sinking on 9 August 1942 of the first HMAS <i>Canberra</i>, with the loss of 84 of her crew, off Savo Island. The <i>Canberra</i> remains the largest Australian warship ever to have been lost in battle. I felt privileged to be at the memorial service for the <i>Canberra</i>, conducted on HMAS <i>Success</i> about 760 metres above the <i>Canberra</i>&apos;s final resting place where I was joined by veterans and some veterans&apos; families. The <i>Canberra</i> rests in Ironbottom Sound, the largest maritime war grave in the world, where over 30 ships and many planes were lost. I visited Bloody Ridge, site of one of the best known of the battles on Guadalcanal, which US Marine Corps General Neller described as hallow ground. This site has now been declared a national park by the Solomon Islands government.</p><p>Australia&apos;s engagements in the Solomon Islands in support of the land offensive of the United States Marine Corps tied up Japanese resources that would otherwise have been deployed at Kokoda and hence turned the tide of the Pacific War. During the war, Australian Coastwatchers worked side by side with island scouts to report on movements and intentions of Japanese forces, work of vital intelligence importance to the Allies. As Australian Coastwatcher John Keenan recalled:</p><p class="italic">Without local help I don&apos;t know what we would have done. We wouldn&apos;t have lasted ten minutes.</p><p>The achievements of the Coastwatchers were summed up by US Fleet Admiral Halsey:</p><p class="italic">The Coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal, and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific.</p><p>Given the longstanding strong ties between our nations and our peoples, in 2003 it was natural for the Solomon Islands to turn to Australia for help in its hour of need. In 2017, as RAMSI prepared to leave, it was equally natural for the Solomon Islanders to ask whether Australia would continue to stand by their side. Australia is inseparably connected to the Solomon Islands and the Pacific region, which is why we responded with a resounding yes to Helpem Fren.</p> </speech>

<p>I&apos;m really pleased to be able to share this afternoon in the acknowledgement of the work of RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. I particularly note the other title that it has, which I think is very meaningful and encapsulates the whole meaning of this exercise—that is, Operation Helpem Fren. In that focus, it talks about how this operation was conceived. It was a cry for help from one of our friends in the Pacific, the Solomon Islands.</p><p>We know that over a period of time there had been violence and disruption in this beautiful country and there was a need for support. At that time, the Solomon Islands cried for help from a friend. Australia, under Prime Minister Howard, responded to that call. But it wasn&apos;t only Australia. As we know, one of the real strengths of the RAMSI exercise was the way that the countries of the Pacific Islands Forum gathered together and made a joint commitment that they would work with the people and the government of the Solomon Islands to ensure that there would be real peace and security in that community.</p><p>I think that over the period of time 2003-17 we saw 15 island nations, including Australia and New Zealand, working together, bringing their skills, professionalism, commitment and sense of area—a sense of being part of the Pacific—to make sure that RAMSI, Operation Helpem Fren, would be a success, and that we would see what we have seen now. We have seen a country that has re-established law and order, a country that has new friends across the Pacific who have worked together to make sure that there will be security in the region, a thriving economy, the opportunity for children to go to school and an opportunity for an effective police force. One of the core elements of this particular process was this commitment to effective law and order and a strong, trained professional police force.</p><p>Senator Fierravanti-Wells and I have many shared experiences. One of those experiences was a visit to the Solomon Islands earlier this year with Senator Wong and Minister Bishop. Among other things, we met with people who had been part of the policing program, and we heard Minister Bishop talk about the pride with which all the participants in RAMSI had seen the way that the police were able to develop not just in their own area, but also to a well-trained organisation that was sharing their skills now, taking the Operation Helpem Fren to help other friends, to ensure that we build on this basis. Minister Bishop particularly mentioned the fact that training is now provided by the Solomon Islands to other Pacific island states. They deploy officers to UN missions across the world, and support disaster relief funds in neighbouring states—places like Vanuatu, following Cyclone Pam.</p><p>One of the real joys of that visit was to see the pride of the newly recruited women members of the police force standing shoulder-to-shoulder in their community of police, to proudly take on the role they had chosen. They had careers working in security for their community. One of the particular elements was engagement in the newly formed domestic violence laws in that nation. That is so inspiring to other countries and so inspiring to the community across all the Solomon Islands. They know that their government, their police force and their community now are committed to ensuring that women and families are safe. The work with the domestic violence shelter provided a high point, I think, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, of our visit.</p><p>Senator Fierravanti-Wells mentioned the loss of life during the commitment to RAMSI, and that has been acknowledged in the other place, where two beautiful speeches were made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten. I have obtained Senator Fierravanti-Wells&apos; approval to table both those speeches. I think they should be tabled. I was particularly impressed by the way Bill Shorten was able to link the history of our relationship with the Solomon Islands to the example and the experience we had through RAMSI and also for hope into the future. It is important to look at the future, because this period, the RAMSI Helpem Fren period, has now been concluded. But that, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells pointed out, is not the end of a relationship; it is the hope for the future of the relationship.</p><p>I want to mention the photographic display that was launched yesterday in this place. The photos were truly beautiful, confronting and inspiring images that looked at the hope for the next phase in the Solomon Islands&apos; community and government. These pictures pulsated with a sense of hope for an optimistic future. Women, families, young people gathered together to acknowledge and celebrate the work of RAMSI but were also looking to the future. We know now of the signed commitments into the future of our ongoing working relationship with our friend, Solomon Islands. We know that there is great hope for this time. We know that our government is committed totally to ensuring that that relationship will continue.</p><p>This has been a genuinely successful exercise in terms of: the engagement of the people across the Pacific; the acknowledgement that there was a need for an intervention; the acknowledgement that that must be done with partnership; and, also, the rebuilding of communities so that when there are more calls—and there will be more calls not just in the Pacific but across our world for support, for help—we know there will be a sound basis, through the work that was done through RAMSI, for further operations of helping friends to be there and to be successful.</p><p>Question agreed to.</p> </speech>

<p>On behalf of the Minister for Veterans&apos; Affairs, Dan Tehan, I table a ministerial statement on veterans and their families.</p><p class="italic"> <i>The statement read as follows—</i></p><p class="italic">As the Prime Minister has said, in these centenary years of Anzac, we best honour the Diggers of the First World War by supporting the servicemen and women, the veterans and the families of today.</p><p class="italic">It is important that all Australians understand the unique nature of service. It is important that all Australians understand what support they currently provide to our veterans. It is important that all Australians understand how we can serve our veterans even better.</p><p class="italic">For the men and women who serve or have served our nation; for their husbands, wives, and children; for their mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers this Ministerial Statement is for you.</p><p class="italic">There are currently around 58,000 Australians serving in our Defence Forces. Some will serve overseas. Others will serve in barracks and bases around our country. No matter who they are, all of them will become veterans.</p><p class="italic">In the Australian community, there are an estimated 320,000 veterans who have been deployed. Many thousands more will not have seen service outside of Australia. These men and women have worn their uniform in both peace time and in conflicts. They have given service from World War Two to the current deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p class="italic">On average, our ADF personnel will serve for around eight and half years. Each year, around 5,200 will leave. Some will leave service and move on to new careers, using the skills and experience of their time in Defence to strengthen our workforce. Some will be business men and women, some will be community leaders, some may enter this Parliament and some will go on to be Governors-General.</p><p class="italic">However, some may not have a choice in leaving. Through medical or administrative discharge, their time in Defence will come to an end.</p><p class="italic">For these veterans, it might be the simple things that are harder. It may be that they haven&apos;t considered what the future may hold. It may also be that they carry with them the burden of service — mental health conditions or injuries that will require support.</p><p class="italic">A key focus of this Government is on how these men and women transition out of the Australian Defence Force.</p><p class="italic">In the last twelve months, over 1,400 members of the Australian Defence Force separated for reasons not of their choosing. Ten years ago, just over 740 members separated involuntarily.</p><p class="italic">How we help these men and women and provide for their transition is integral to ensuring that none of them fall through the gap between Defence and civilian life.</p><p class="italic">It is at this point that we as a Government, and as Australians, can make a real difference. This task begins in the Department of Defence and continues with the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs.</p><p class="italic">Currently, the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs supports about 291,000 Australians. Just over half of these people are veterans or currently serving members of the ADF. Around 48 percent are women. Around 82,000 are widows or widowers and around 2,500 are children of veterans.</p><p class="italic">Today, more than 203,000 of DVA&apos;s clients are 65 years or over while about 23,000 are under the age of 40.</p><p class="italic">This is the state of our veterans in Australia. They are representative of every aspect of service and from every walk of life. They are old and young. They are from the country and the city.</p><p class="italic">It is why, in the last twelve months, the Government has held the first Female Veterans Forum and the first Veterans Families Forum. It is why we have held the first meeting of State and Territory veterans ministers, to provide input on how we can work together across all levels of government on issues such as veteran homelessness.</p><p class="italic">Serving our veterans requires our Government and Australians to acknowledge the various backgrounds and needs of the veteran community in order to put our help where it is most needed.</p><p class="italic">Australians should be proud that we recognise the importance of service and remain one of the only countries with an independent Department to serve our veterans. The Government is committed to maintaining a stand-alone Department for our veterans.</p><p class="italic">This year, DVA will provide over $11 billion in payments and services. That includes pensions, income support, compensation, healthcare, rehabilitation, counselling services, transport, transition assistance, home care, housing, commemorations, education and grants funding.</p><p class="italic">Around $6.2 billion, or 54 percent of the Department&apos;s budget, will be spent on providing veterans and their families with income support and compensation.</p><p class="italic">Around $5 billion, 44 percent of the Department&apos;s budget will be spent on meeting the healthcare needs of veterans and their families.</p><p class="italic">1 am pleased to note that in the recent renegotiation of hospital agreements we have secured priority for private rooms for veterans, wherever possible.</p><p class="italic">I&apos;d also like to note that the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs provides medical services to veterans and war widows by making payments to providers that are significantly higher than Medicare rebates. This ensures the widest possible availability of providers for those we serve.</p><p class="italic">Around 0.8 percent of the Department&apos;s budget will be spent on commemorations and maintaining memorials and headstones.</p><p class="italic">Over 95 percent of the Department&apos;s budget comprises payments that are legislated, fully-funded and uncapped.</p><p class="italic">If there is a need, it will be funded and the Department will provide assistance.</p><p class="italic">For example, in the 2017/18 Budget, DVA is estimated to spend $1] .3 billion but if more veterans present with eligible claims, this figure may be higher.</p><p class="italic">The Department employs around 2,000 staff throughout Australia. About a third of them are headquartered in Canberra. The rest are spread across offices in each state and territory, in capital cities and regional towns.</p><p class="italic">In a typical 9 to 5, five-day week, DVA will process about 95 compensation or income support forms every hour, receive two letters or emails every minute, and take a phone call every couple of seconds.</p><p class="italic">The administration costs of the Department represent less than three cents of every dollar it spends.</p><p class="italic">DVA works hard to provide quick and strong support for veterans and their families. But it is not perfect. People make mistakes. As a result, the Department will not always get it right.</p><p class="italic">In this first Ministerial Statement on Veterans and Their Families, I also want to reflect on what we need to do better.</p><p class="italic">Some in the veteran community have found the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs to be adversarial, slow or bureaucratic.</p><p class="italic">In the Department&apos;s satisfaction survey, we have seen a distinct decline in overall satisfaction from 93 percent in 2010 to 83 percent in 2016. While this number is still high, it represents where the Department could have served veterans better.</p><p class="italic">For example, at the Veterans&apos; Review Board there were over 2,900 decisions made in 2015/16. Of these, nearly half were made to change or reverse the decision of the Department.</p><p class="italic">If veterans are not satisfied with a decision of the review board, they may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</p><p class="italic">In 2015/16, 223 of the 307 rulings of the Administrative Appeal Tribunal were made against the Department.</p><p class="italic">We know that getting decisions right the first time can make an enormous difference to veterans. We are working to reduce the number of cases that go to administrative review. This will be good news to our volunteer advocates, who assist veterans with their appeals.</p><p class="italic">Recently, we have implemented a trial of Alternative Dispute Resolution for veterans who choose to appeal a decision with the Veterans&apos; Review Board. As a result, cases that may have taken up to a year to resolve have been resolved in as little as three months. We are now rolling this out nationwide.</p><p class="italic">In 2013/14, wait times for initial liability under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act were 144 days and 160 days respectively. They have now come down to 107 and 1 10 days respectively.</p><p class="italic">However, permanent impairment claims have gone from 129 days and 112 days to 156 and 148 days respectively. This is not good enough and the Department has been tasked to improve it.</p><p class="italic">The Department is working on ways to leverage technology to deliver better services and cut paperwork. For example, some claims that used to take 117 days to process now only take 60 days. These trials are promising and the Department is looking at how we can implement them across the system.</p><p class="italic">However, we can only have a better service from DVA if they have the tools to do the job. We have listened to the veteran community on the need to put them first with DVA.</p><p class="italic">We have made the first serious investment in years into the Department — $166.6 million towards making DVA a 21st century Department with a 21st century service culture. This includes a significant investment in upgrading DVA&apos;s computer systems and processes. Claims and wait times will be cut by this investment, something that is long overdue.</p><p class="italic">One of the most important services we provide is mental health support. In this first Ministerial Statement on Veterans and Their Families, I would like to focus on the issue of veteran mental health.</p><p class="italic">The Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs spend more than $244 million a year on providing mental health support and treatment to current and former ADF members. This includes services provided by GPs, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and hospitals as well as pharmaceuticals and online information and support tools.</p><p class="italic">It also includes access to the Veteran and Veterans&apos; Family Counselling Service (VVCS), which is at the frontline of the Government&apos;s veteran mental health support response and has been for more than 35 years. This service is part of the strong legacy of our Vietnam veterans, whose experience has informed how we care for modem veterans.</p><p class="italic">VVCS provides free and, importantly, confidential counselling and support for current and former members of the ADF and their families.</p><p class="italic">It has 26 centres around Australia and a network of more than 1,100 outreach clinicians. It delivers services to more than 27,000 members of the ADF community and their families annually.</p><p class="italic">We know, the burden of mental health conditions can also fall on families of veterans.</p><p class="italic">Over two years the Government has expanded. VVCS to include as many families as possible. The recent Budget has provided $8.5 million to continue to expand eligibility for VVCS.</p><p class="italic">We recognise that as a result of a veteran&apos;s service, children can be affected. In March the Government allocated $2.1 million over two years to the Australian Kookaburra Kids Foundation to deliver age appropriate mental health education to the children of veterans with a mental health condition.</p><p class="italic">We know mental health treatments work best when intervention is early. The faster that we provide support to veterans, the better their chances of recovery and for mitigating any long-term impact.</p><p class="italic">For many years, Governments only provided mental health support when a veteran was able to prove their condition was caused by their service.</p><p class="italic">Last year, the Turnbull Government decided that Australia should provide its veterans with free and immediate mental health treatment.</p><p class="italic">Under the scheme, any veteran who had served one day in the full-time ADF would be given full cover for five of the most common mental health conditions: post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and substance abuse.</p><p class="italic">For the first time, an eligible veteran with one of these conditions didn&apos;t have to prove it was caused by service. From the moment of contact with the Department to register their need for support, we would be there for them.</p><p class="italic">The Turnbull Government has now completed this reform.</p><p class="italic">In this year&apos;s budget, we have covered all mental health conditions. From now on any veteran of the full-time ADF will get free and immediate mental health cover.</p><p class="italic">This programme of non-liability mental healthcare is fully funded and completely uncapped — if there is a need it will be met.</p><p class="italic">This common sense approach to mental health support is the biggest change in veterans&apos; policy in decades and we must continue to build on it.</p><p class="italic">As all Australians know, one suicide is one too many. Suicide affects all areas of our community ¬eight Australians a day take their own life and it remains the greatest cause of death for men between the ages of 14 and 44.</p><p class="italic">As we have seen, our veterans and members the ADF are sadly not immune. We are determined to address suicide in our community. Everyone has a role to play.</p><p class="italic">Last year the Government commissioned the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to provide the first accurate, robust data ever produced on suicide among the serving and ex-serving populations.</p><p class="italic">This study was independent of the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs. This research is providing a greater understanding on where and how to help those who are struggling.</p><p class="italic">The AIHW study has revealed the suicide rate is 53 percent lower for men serving full-time in the ADF and 49 percent lower for men in the reserves when compared to the general population.</p><p class="italic">In all male ex-serving members, the rate of suicide is 13 percent higher than the general population.</p><p class="italic">However, men who have left the ADF between the age of 18 and 24 have twice the risk of suicide compared to their peers.</p><p class="italic">The Government will continue to independently track this data in order to provide support.</p><p class="italic">This information is informing our approach to suicide prevention.</p><p class="italic">The Government also asked the National Mental Health Commission to review the suicide prevention services offered by Defence and DVA. Their comprehensive report told us to target four areas:</p><p class="italic">1. Improving suicide prevention and mental health support for serving ADF, veterans and their families.</p><p class="italic">2. Improving the transition process from the ADF.</p><p class="italic">3. Improving family support.</p><p class="italic">4. Transforming DVA&apos;s systems. processes and culture.</p><p class="italic">These reviews helped infomi the Government&apos;s action on veterans&apos; mental health in this year&apos;s Budget, which included an additional $58.6 million in mental health funding.</p><p class="italic">As part of this, the Government is investing $9.8 million to pilot new approaches to suicide prevention and improve care and support available to veterans. This will include funding to increase support for those discharging from hospital and who are at risk.</p><p class="italic">The Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs also has a range of suicide awareness and prevention resources, known collectively as Operation Life.</p><p class="italic">As I have already said, the moment a member of the ADF becomes a veteran is crucial so we must do better at the transition Process.</p><p class="italic">Just as members of the ADF prepare for being posted to a deployment, we should prepare them for posting to civilian life.</p><p class="italic">To give some idea, when a soldier leaves the ADF they may have never filled out a rental application, written a resume or used a Medicare card.</p><p class="italic">We know that for some ADF personnel, the transition period can bring significant change and with that change comes stress.</p><p class="italic">For example, until January last year the Department of Defence didn&apos;t have the capacity to notify the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs when a serving member became a veteran. Until a recent change in policy, DVA only knew of around one in five ADF members leaving Defence.</p><p class="italic">An important component of this is the Early Engagement Model. The aim of the Early Engagement Model is that when a serving or former ADF member needs DVA in the future, they will already be registered with the Department. This will reduce claims processing times.</p><p class="italic">Another reform that will improve our processes will be to allow Defence, the Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to share medical information on a veteran in order to save them from having to undergo up to three separate medical assessments.</p><p class="italic">Additionally, this Government took to the last election a commitment to &apos;No Discharge Without Documentation&apos;. This initiative will ensure all separating members of the ADF leave with the necessary documents to make the transition phase more seamless. This includes their medical and training records.</p><p class="italic">This ongoing work is led by a Transition Taskforce that was established after the last election.</p><p class="italic">Veterans need to be able to walk into civilian life with confidence and dignity.</p><p class="italic">This Government is committed to making that happen through the Prime Minister&apos;s Veterans&apos; Employment Initiative.</p><p class="italic">As the Prime Minister has said, this is not about charity. We are not asking businesses to engage in some sort of philanthropic exercise. We want to remind business leaders that the servicemen and women of Australia have unique skills and extraordinary experience.</p><p class="italic">The Initiative is about helping business appreciate the unique skills former ADF members can bring to a job. Launched last November, it highlights the Government&apos;s commitment to improving the support provided to veterans during their transition out of the ADF.</p><p class="italic">Through the program&apos;s Industry Advisory Committee on Veterans&apos; Employment we will develop strategies for business to recognise and transfer the talents of our veterans into post-service careers.</p><p class="italic">Already over 1,000 jobs on the jobactive website have been identified as veteran-preferred and we will have more to say on The Prime Minister&apos;s Veterans&apos; Employment initiative in the coming months.</p><p class="italic">A key reason for giving this statement is to outline how Australia can do better for its veterans. As a Government we commit today to the following:</p><p class="italic">I . A stand-alone Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs;</p><p class="italic">2. A Department that focuses on the needs of the veteran first; and</p><p class="italic">3. A stronger voice for the veterans&apos; community.</p><p class="italic">It is imperative that Australia continues to provide veterans with their own Department. It is the best way that their service and unique needs will be recognised and provided for.</p><p class="italic">However, we acknowledge that the Department must focus on the needs of those it serves as a priority. Veteran Centric Reform, providing funding for the upgrade of the Department&apos;s systems, and an improved service culture are the first steps.</p><p class="italic">Veterans&apos; Affairs legislation is complex. Across three Acts, the support that is provided to different ages and cohorts can be difficult to navigate. Parliament is looking at how we can begin to modernise and simplify this legislation. This includes placing all the relevant Acts under the control of the Minister for Veterans&apos; Affairs.</p><p class="italic">In any effort to provide support, we should also look to how we can provide payments faster. The time between making a claim and receiving rehabilitation can be lengthy. This year&apos;s Budget has provided for a pilot to provide rehabilitation to veterans as soon as they have submitted their claims rather than after approval. If this leads to better outcomes, Parliament should look to developing this model over time across the veteran entitlement system.</p><p class="italic">Equally, we need to ensure that when the veteran community speaks, it does so with one voice. My challenge to the veteran community is for them to respond to this statement each year with a single voice so that we can better serve all veterans.</p><p class="italic">In other countries, veterans&apos; organisations have united together into a national confederation or association, with the varied and differing needs of each group within the community putting forward their needs through a single body. I believe it is time that veterans&apos; organisations create a similar body in Australia.</p><p class="italic">If veterans can form this body and provide a response to this statement with one voice, I will ensure their response is tabled in Parliament annually.</p><p class="italic">All of these are projects that will make our systems of support for service stronger. We must commit to them each year in order to ensure progress.</p><p class="italic">As a Parliament it is our duty to watch over the care we provide our veterans. To ensure these men and women are provided for and that future generations understand their sacrifice. This Ministerial Statement on Veterans and Their Families is an important part of that duty. It will be the touchstone of how we mark our service to them each year.</p> </speech>

<p>I move:</p><p class="italic">That this bill be now read a second time.</p><p>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <i>Hansard</i>.</p><p>Leave granted.</p><p class="italic"> <i>The speech read as follows—</i></p><p class="italic">The Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017implements the commitment the government made on 20 April 2017 to strengthen the requirements for Australian citizenship. It also incorporates a number of integrity measures introduced into the last parliament.</p><p class="italic">Australian citizenship is an extraordinary privilege. Pathways to citizenship give new migrants the opportunity to be full and active participants in Australian society.</p><p class="italic">Citizenship was first defined in Australian law in the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, and came into force on Australia Day 1949. Since then, more than five million people have chosen to become Australian citizens.</p><p class="italic">Australians come from every culture, every race, every faith and every nation. Together we have built a modern and prosperous Australia. The success of our nation is based on our shared values, rights and responsibilities.</p><p class="italic">The measures contained in this bill will help us build on this success. It will ensure we continue to welcome new Australians committed to making a positive contribution through the many opportunities our country affords.</p><p class="italic">As a government, we are committed to maintaining strong public confidence and support for our migration and citizenship programmes – through an assurance of integrity to the Australian public.</p><p class="italic">We are proud of our heritage and generosity as a nation. We look forward to continuing to welcome new migrants – irrespective of race, religion, national or ethnic origin – who embrace our Australian laws and values, and who seek to contribute to, rather than undermine, our society.</p><p class="italic">The measures in this bill commencing from 20 April 2017 are the government&apos;s response to the 2015 <i>National consultation on citizenship – your right, your responsibility</i>, which indicated strong community support for strengthening the test for Australian citizenship. The Australian community expects that aspiring citizens demonstrate their allegiance to Australia, their commitment to live in accordance with Australian laws and values, and be willing to integrate into and become contributing members of the Australian community.</p><p class="italic">In accordance with the announced measures, there will be an increase in the general residence requirement. An applicant for Australian citizenship will need to demonstrate a minimum of four years of permanent residence immediately prior to their application for citizenship, with a maximum of 12 months outside of Australia in this time period. This represents a change from the current requirement of a minimum of 12 months as a permanent resident. Strengthening the residency requirement is intended to support integration and facilitate a more thorough evaluation of a person&apos;s commitment to Australia, our values and adherence to our laws. It also brings Australia more in line with the general requirements of other nations.</p><p class="italic">The <i>National c</i><i>onsultation</i> found <i>&quot;</i><i>A residence requirement in citizenship law is an objective measure of a person</i><i>&apos;</i><i>s association with Australia. It also serves as a probationary period, so that a person</i><i>&apos;</i><i>s word and deeds across this time can be considered should the person apply for Australian citizenship. Increasing the value and integrity of citizenship by changing the residence requirement from four years lawful stay to four years permanent residence is appropriate…</i><i>&quot;</i></p><p class="italic">The government is also introducing a requirement to have competent English language through listening, speaking, reading and writing skills.</p><p class="italic">English language is essential for economic participation and social cohesion. The Productivity Commission in 2016 highlighted the importance of English language proficiency for integration and settlement outcomes. There is also strong public support to ensure aspiring citizens are fully able to participate in Australian life, by speaking English, our national language.</p><p class="italic">Aspiring citizens are currently required to possess a level of &apos;basic&apos; English. This is indirectly assessed when an applicant sits the citizenship test. Aspiring citizens will now be required to undertake a separate upfront English language test with an accredited provider and achieve a level of &apos;competent&apos;. There will be exemptions, such as for applicants over 60 years of age, or under 16 years of age at the time they applied for citizenship or those with an enduring or permanent mental or physical incapacity. There will be other exemptions from testing, as is currently the case for skilled migration assessments, such as for citizens of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, the United States of America or New Zealand who hold a valid passport, or for applicants who have undertaken specified English language studies at a recognised Australian education institution.</p><p class="italic">Applicants will be required to sign an Australian Values Statement in order to make a valid application for citizenship. It will require applicants to make an undertaking to integrate into and contribute to the Australian community. The current Australian Values Statement includes an understanding of:</p><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><p class="italic">Applicants will be required to demonstrate their integration into the Australian community in accordance with Australian values.</p><p class="italic">For example, this may include:</p><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><p class="italic">The bill provides that the minister may determine changes to the text and requirements in relation to the Australian Values Statement by legislative instrument. Values based questions will also be added to the citizenship test.</p><p class="italic">The Department of Immigration and Border Protection will assess this information based on documents provided as part of an aspiring citizen&apos;s application and may also assess this at interview.</p><p class="italic">In addition to existing police checks which are undertaken as part of an application for citizenship, an applicant will also be assessed for specified conduct that is inconsistent with Australian values, such as domestic or family violence, criminality including female genital mutilation and involvement in gangs and organised crime.</p><p class="italic">The pledge will be extended to all streams of citizenship by application, including citizenship by descent, adoption and resumption. Applicants over 16 years of age will need to make the pledge before they can become a citizen. Applicants for citizenship by conferral on the grounds of being born in Papua, born to a former citizen or under statelessness provisions, will no longer be exempt from making the pledge. Exemptions will include permanent or enduring physical or mental incapacity.</p><p class="italic">The pledge will also refer to allegiance to Australia. The government has separately passed legislation to provide for the loss of citizenship of dual-nationals who betray their allegiance through involvement in terrorist related activity.</p><p class="italic">Consistent with measures introduced in the last parliament by the former minister, the bill contains additional measures to improve the integrity of the citizenship programme.</p><p class="italic">Currently, only aspiring citizens aged 18 years and over are required to meet the &apos;good character&apos; requirement – which involves criminal history checks. There is a small minority of people under 18 who clearly do not meet community expectations of good character and have been involved in serious or violent crime, such as gang violence. The bill amends these provisions to require all applicants, including those under 18, to be of good character.</p><p class="italic">The bill also amends the offence provisions to reflect modern sentencing practices, including where a person is subject to a court order for home detention or where they have not been sentenced to prison but are nonetheless under obligations to a court.</p><p class="italic">The bill provides that approval must be cancelled if the minister is no longer satisfied of the applicant&apos;s identity or if they have become a risk to national security. The minister may also cancel approval if satisfied that the person no longer meets other eligibility requirements. The bill extends the maximum period of time where the Minister can delay an applicant making the pledge of allegiance from 12 months to two years, to better align with timeframes of some complex investigations.</p><p class="italic">The bill provides for the revocation of citizenship where a person became a citizen as a result of fraud or misrepresentation. The minister must be satisfied that it would be contrary to the public interest for the person to remain a citizen. While law enforcement agencies, for a range of reasons, may not be in a position to prosecute all forms of fraud and misrepresentation in the citizenship process, the government is committed to providing the highest levels of integrity where possible. Each person being considered for revocation of their Australian citizenship would be given natural justice before the minister makes a decision. A decision to revoke citizenship on these grounds would be open to judicial review.</p><p class="italic">Currently, the act provides that a person is deemed never to have been an Australian citizen where they attained citizenship by descent, but were later found not to have had an Australian parent at the time of birth. There have been difficult cases in recent times in relation to this. There have been people who were registered as Australian citizens by descent, thought they were Australian all their lives, but have been found later in life not to have been eligible in the first place and consequently deemed to have never been a citizen.</p><p class="italic">The proposed amendments repeal the operation of law provision and insert a discretionary power. This will allow the circumstances of a particular case to be taken into account when deciding if citizenship by descent should be revoked.</p><p class="italic">Currently under the act, children acquire citizenship automatically if they are born in Australia to an Australian citizen or permanent resident parent, or if they are ordinarily resident in Australia until their 10th birthday. The bill specifies the automatic acquisition of citizenship on a person&apos;s 10th birthday applies to those persons who have maintained lawful residence in Australia throughout the 10 years, including maintaining a right to return if they travel outside Australia during those years. These amendments will not affect access to citizenship by children born in Australia to New Zealand citizens or children who are stateless. The changes also remove the automatic acquisition of citizenship on the 10th birthday of a child in Australia born to a parent with diplomatic or consular privileges and immunities.</p><p class="italic">The provision giving citizenship to children found abandoned in Australia is also amended to be consistent with the original policy intent, which is to reflect Australia&apos;s international obligations under the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.</p><p class="italic">The bill also amends the definition of &apos;spouse&apos; and &apos;de facto partner&apos; to be consistent with the Migration Act and to reflect the policy position that the relationship between the applicant and their Australian citizen spouse or partner must be genuine and continuing.</p><p class="italic">The majority of applicants for citizenship have come to Australia originally on a visa in accordance with the Migration Act. Personal information is collected through the visa process and is relevant when the person applies for citizenship. Likewise, personal information collected about a person under the Citizenship Act can be relevant if the department is considering whether to cancel a person&apos;s visa after a citizenship application has been refused. The bill provides that personal information collected under one act and associated regulations may be used and disclosed for the purposes of the other.</p><p class="italic">We have seen in recent times a number of Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) migration decisions that are outside community standards. This has also occurred in relation to citizenship decisions. Specifically, the AAT has found that people were of good character despite having been convicted of child sexual offences, manslaughter, people smuggling or domestic violence.</p><p class="italic">The bill seeks to better align the powers in the Citizenship Act with the Migration Act to remedy decisions that may be outside of community standards. The provisions will allow the minister to personally set aside certain decisions of the AAT if it is in the public interest to do so. Consistent with the Migration Act, personal decisions of the minister will not be subject to merits review. However, such decisions would still be subject to judicial review in the Federal or High Court. The new provision does not propose to exclude or limit judicial review.</p><p class="italic">The bill makes a range of other and consequential amendments to support the integrity of the citizenship programme.</p><p class="italic">Conclusion</p><p class="italic">The measures in this bill enhance the institution of citizenship.</p><p class="italic">As many have rightly acknowledged, we are one of the most successful migrant nations in the world today.</p><p class="italic">We have prospered and forged a secure and harmonious society. This has been built by people of every possible background, united by common values that include a commitment to the rule of law; freedom – including of religion and speech; support for Parliamentary democracy; equality of men and women; equality of opportunity for individuals; community involvement; and the pursuit of opportunity through education, employment and entrepreneurship.</p><p class="italic">We should never take our success for granted.</p><p class="italic">This bill reinforces the integrity of our citizenship programme. This will help maintain strong public support for migration and the value of Australian citizenship in what is an increasingly challenging national security environment and complex global security situation.</p><p class="italic">The measures in this bill will ensure we continue to welcome people committed to the success of our great nation – enriching our society and building our economic prosperity.</p> </speech>

<p>I seek leave to make a statement from the opposition on the veterans and their families.</p><p>Leave granted.</p><p>Serving as a member of the Australian Defence Force involves risk and sacrifice. In acknowledgement of this service and sacrifice, our country needs to support our veterans and their families now and into the future. Families play a unique role within the military life and service, themselves making many sacrifices. Our ADF personnel and veterans look to their families for support while in service, in transition and in civilian life. These men and women and children are the unsung heroes of our defence forces. This is why it is important to ensure that they have the support they need to address the unique challenges of military life. After all, greater support for our military families is greater support for our serving and ex-service personnel.</p><p>In June, the opposition announced that we would develop a strategy to provide greater support and resources to military families. This was to implement the key recommendations of the National Mental Health Commission&apos;s review into the services available to veterans and current serving members of the Australian Defence Force in relation to prevention of self-harm and suicide. Developing a family engagement and support strategy will identify where we can provide greater support to military families, those who matter most to our ADF personnel and veterans: their wives, husbands, sons and daughters. Labor&apos;s commitment to develop a family engagement and support strategy in government would be co-designed with defence and veteran families and communities to focus on known stress points for families, including transition for defence members into civilian life.</p><p>The NMHC&apos;s review highlighted that there is currently a lack of emphasis on the critical role that families play in the lives of current and former serving members. There is no doubt that families play a critical role in providing support to serving and ex-service personnel suffering from mental health issues. Developing a family strategy acknowledges the important role of families in the rehabilitation of ADF members and veterans from both physical and mental injury and illness. Families can be the greatest support when dealing with life-changing events that can occur throughout and after military service.</p><p>Labor acknowledges that it is vital that government and parliament continue to work in a collaborative way with these ex-service organisations to ensure that there is no-one falling through the gaps. That is why Labor has supported the government&apos;s additional funding to rectify DVA&apos;s longstanding ICT issues, along with expanded access to non-liability health care for any member of the ADF who has served one day. To veterans: we value your dedication and your feedback. We want to know where we can do better. We recognise that the effort should never stop and that the job is never done.</p><p>Labor looks forward to continuing its work with veterans and the ex-service community and with the government and the department to ensure that we continue to strive for the best outcomes for our ex-service personnel and their families.</p> </speech>

<p>Labor opposed this bill because there are significant problems with the bill as it is placed before the Senate. A number of amendments will be moved by Labor to try and make this bill a more acceptable bill, a fairer bill and a more reasonable bill. We will be seeking in our amendments to extend the application of the prohibition of unreasonable demands for money by employers to prospective employees. That&apos;s an issue that we are very concerned about. We want to put the AAT and the ombudsman oversight into the compulsory questioning powers. We&apos;ve got lots of experience with the work of the Fair Work Building Commission and the ABCC and the misuse of compulsory questioning powers and the bias that has been applied by the Fair Work Building Commission and the ABCC over the years. There is lots of evidence about problems in that area, and the need for oversight is essential.</p><p>We want to extend franchisor liability to labour hire and supply chains and reverse the onus of proof. All of the principled issues that you&apos;ve heard that are supposedly applying only to franchisees and franchisors apply to many companies using labour hire companies to steal wages from workers. We don&apos;t believe that we should limit this to franchisors and not deal with the wider issue across industry that does the same thing which leaves workers with their wages stolen. Whether it&apos;s done by franchisors or by a farmer using labour hire companies to rip off workers in the farm industry, it doesn&apos;t matter. Whether it&apos;s Caltex or that well-known one, Baiada; whether it&apos;s Myers, whose labour hire companies were ripping workers off; whether it&apos;s the fruit producers who allow labour hire companies to have some organised crime figures in there ripping migrant workers off, we think that it should be dealt with and we think this is far too narrow.</p><p>Our view is supported by submissions from the Australian Industry Group and from the Australian franchisors themselves who ask why they should be picked out and narrowed out in this bill. We agree with those employers that it should be wider. If stealing a worker&apos;s wages is a problem in the franchise industry, it&apos;s similarly a problem in areas like Caltex, Baiada, Myer and fruit producers. It should be dealt with more widely. Reversing the onus of proof is essential, and I&apos;ll go to some of those issues when I go to the amendments in detail.</p><p>We want to reverse the onus of proof and claims for unpaid wages where the employer has not kept or produced wage slips. One of the great victories that the minister was boasting about in the last term of parliament was that she was going to make sure that employers kept wage slips. Employers are not keeping wage slips. Some employers are still ripping workers off, mercilessly. We&apos;ve got a range of amendments that we want to deal with in the second reading. By leave—I move items (21), (24), (27) and (35) on sheet 8144 together:</p><p class="italic">(21) Schedule 1, item 17, page 12 (lines 19 and 20), omit paragraph (i), substitute:</p><p class="italic">  (i) subsection 325(1) (which deals with unreasonable requirements on employees to spend or pay amounts);</p><p class="italic">  (ia) subsection 325(1A) (which deals with unreasonable requirements on prospective employees to spend or pay amounts);</p><p class="italic">(24) Schedule 1, item 22, page 15 (after line 8), after subsection 325(1), insert:</p><p class="italic">  (1A) An employer (the <i>prospective employer</i>) must not directly or indirectly require another person (the <i>prospective employee</i>) to spend, or pay to the prospective employer or any other person, an amount of the prospective employee&apos;s money if:</p><p class="italic">  (a) the requirement is in connection with employment or potential employment of the prospective employee by the prospective employer; and</p><p class="italic">  (b) the requirement is unreasonable in the circumstances; and</p><p class="italic">(c) the payment is directly or indirectly for the benefit of the prospective employer or a party related to the prospective employer.</p><p class="italic">Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).</p><p class="italic">(27) Schedule 1, item 26, page 16 (lines 24 to 25), omit paragraph (i), substitute:</p><p class="italic">  (i) subsection 325(1) (which deals with unreasonable requirements on employees to spend or pay amounts);</p><p class="italic">  (ia) subsection 325(1A) (which deals with unreasonable requirements on prospective employees to spend or pay amounts);</p><p class="italic">(35) Schedule 1, item 57, page 30 (line 15), omit &quot;Subsection 325(1) of the amended Act applies&quot;, substitute &quot;Subsections 325(1) and (1A) of the amended Act apply&quot;.</p><p>These amendments are dealing with the issue of extending the application of the prohibition of unreasonable demands for money by an employer to prospective employees. The bill introduces a new civil remedy offence of unreasonably requiring an employee to spend or pay an amount of their money in relation to the performance of work. The Senate committee inquiry revealed stakeholder concerns that this new offence will not cover unreasonable demands made by employers to prospective employees as a condition of employment. Submissions to the inquiry identified the behaviour allegedly engaged in by a Domino&apos;s franchise where sponsorship for a working visa and a job was offered on the condition of payment of $150,000, as an example.</p><p>While it would appear that that particular pre-employment requirement for an upfront payment linked to the provision of a visa may be prohibited by other legislation, other unreasonable pre-employment requirements are not. These amendments extend the application of the new offence to prospective employees. So, Minister, could you take me to why these amendments are not reasonable amendments and why you would have unreasonable demands still being available to employers? We think the amendments that we put forward strengthen the bill. I&apos;d like to hear your views as to why that wouldn&apos;t be a legitimate and reasonable approach.</p><p>The CHAIR: Before I call the minister, Senator Cameron, I&apos;m just checking: so we are looking at opposition amendments which are in the fifth box down. But I draw to your attention: it says 21 and then 24 to 27?</p><p>Yes. I&apos;m sorry. To clarify—there&apos;s 21, and 24 to 27. I&apos;m sorry, that was my—</p><p>The CHAIR: Yes, so that&apos;s the fifth box down.</p><p>Yes, and 35 together.</p> </speech>

<p>Yes.</p><p>The CHAIR: Minister, I call you now.</p><p>In the first instance, in responding to the amendments, could I just explain what a cashback scam is for the benefit of the Senate. A cashback scam is a request from an employer that an employee pay back part of their wages to the employer or a third party. What this effectively does is let the employers undercut the safety net while appearing, at face value, to comply with workplace rules. It is particularly difficult to prove as vulnerable workers are unlikely to make a complaint and there is often no paper trail. The cashback scam was most notably used by some 7-Eleven franchisees, but the scam also emerged during other investigations undertaken by the Fair Work Ombudsman. In the most severe cases, employers have threatened to revoke visas and have employees deported if they spoke about the maltreatment.</p><p>In terms of what the bill, as currently drafted, actually does, the bill addresses cashback scams by making it clear that it&apos;s unlawful for an employer to demand an employee pay a proportion of their wages back. Cashback scams may attract the higher penalties which apply to serious contraventions under the act. The provisions only prohibit unreasonable requests to spend an amount, not legitimate requests for overpayments to be returned, because there may well be legitimate circumstances in which an employer requests that money be paid back to them.</p><p>In terms of the amendments that have been moved by the opposition, this amendment would extend the prohibition on unreasonable requirements on employees to spend or pay an amount, which is referred to as the cashback provision, to include requirements made of prospective employees to spend or pay an amount in connection with their prospective employment. The government is opposing Labor&apos;s amendment, as moved by Senator Cameron, that extends the prohibition on unreasonable requirements to spend to prospective employees. The effect of the amendment, as it is currently drafted, would extend the cashback prohibition to include requirements for prospective employees to spend or pay an amount in connection with employment.</p><p>The government is unable to support this amendment for two reasons: the provisions, as they are currently drafted—and it may just be very bad drafting on behalf of the opposition—are incredibly broad and are more than likely going to lead to unintended consequences; and the unacceptable conduct the amendment is trying to deal with may often already be unlawful under other laws.</p><p>In terms of the unintended consequences—and, again, it may just be very bad drafting—there are many reasons why an employer might require a prospective employee to spend an amount of money. Employees, often required to be located near their workplace, may be willing to relocate to take up a job offer. If an employer tells prospective employees about job location requirements, is it reasonable for the worker to ask the employer for their relocation costs? While this might be negotiated between the parties, it would be unreasonable to create a legal requirement around this. What about asking a worker to pay for their own travel costs to attend an interview face to face? Again, this is captured by the amendment that is being moved on behalf of the opposition.</p><p>Whilst I&apos;m sympathetic to some of the cases identified by the Melbourne based community legal centre WEstjustice in their Senate committee submission, I also point out that many of these instances that they themselves describe would likely be captured by other existing laws which come with some very serious sanctions. For example, there was the migrant worker who was allegedly asked to pay a $2,500 cash bond for the use of a work vehicle and to access a building site. The job never eventuated, and the prospective employer disappeared. This sort of conduct is, of course, completely, totally and utterly unacceptable, and it is almost certainly an offence under criminal law. I would encourage anyone who believes that they are the victim of this type of theft or fraud to contact the police.</p><p>In terms of vulnerable migrant workers paying for a visa outcome: in 2015, under the coalition government, civil and criminal penalties were introduced under the Migration Act for people who ask for, receive, offer or provide a benefit in return for a visa sponsorship or employment that requires a visa sponsorship outcome. These changes came out of a review into the integrity of the 457 visa program that I announced in 2014 when I was the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I also understand that this issue has been raised in the context of 417: working holiday makers spending money in relation to the 88-day regional work requirements in order to secure an extension to their visa. This continues to be a complex issue, and it is one that I will request the Migrant Workers&apos; Taskforce to consider.</p><p>Just by way of further background: in March 2016 the Federal Court handed down penalties against a company that offered vulnerable migrant workers training and sponsored employment in the cleaning industry that would supposedly lead to permanent residency. Many of these workers paid in excess of $10,000 each. The court found that the company never had any cleaning jobs available, and, in any event, cleaning jobs would not have met the skill requirements necessary for permanent residency under the relevant visa requirements. I understand that the fines that were handed down were approximately $700,000 for the employer and $300,000 for the director, so that was a total of $1 million in fines.</p><p>Again, in terms of the cashback provisions that the bill seeks to address, these types of scams are wrong, and they need to be stopped, and the bill does that. But in terms of the extension of the cashback provision to prospective employees, in particular in the sloppy drafting that has been presented to the Senate, the government cannot support the amendment, because of the very serious unintended consequences by way of the fact that the provisions presented by the opposition are incredibly broad.</p> </speech>

<p>This is typical of Senator Cash and this government: go some way to try and deal with an issue but don&apos;t actually deal with all of the circumstances that are required to be dealt with. Senator Cash has indicated that she thinks this is incredibly broad and will have unintended consequences. I&apos;ll tell you what is broad, and that is the stealing of workers&apos; wages across the economy. And it&apos;s not just in franchising; it&apos;s in a whole range of areas. The unintended consequence of where we are at the moment is that some of the most vulnerable workers in this country end up having their wages stolen, not being able to feed their family and not being able to put a roof over their head. And people are getting away with it.</p><p>This bill sets out the principle that if you are in employment then there is a prohibition on unreasonable demands for money. The same principle should apply if a prospective employee is seeking employment. I know the minister is still a bit embarrassed after the fiasco we had with the last fair work bill we had here, because of the demonstrably sloppy drafting. The minister had to accept amendment after amendment after amendment because the drafting from the government was so bad. That&apos;s why tonight we&apos;re getting a bit of payback, a bit of rhetoric and a bit of rubbish from the minister on this issue.</p><p>What we say in these amendments is that it has to be unreasonable in the circumstances. It is defined, it is qualified and it goes to making sure that we don&apos;t have prospective employees accepting a job on a condition of employment that is unreasonable in the circumstances. This is probably where a worker is actually more vulnerable—when they&apos;re a prospective employee and they&apos;re not on the job, especially if the job has a union on the site. If you are rolling up for a job then this is a bit like the old Work Choices era, where a prospective employee is given a demand by the employer and they either sign or just go because they don&apos;t get the job.</p><p>This is where workers have specific vulnerabilities. I don&apos;t think that restricting this to where the minister wants it restricted to actually deals with the wage theft that is out there. The principle of &apos;unreasonable demands&apos; remains the same whether you are a prospective employee or an employee. You should not be subject to unreasonable demands. That&apos;s the point we are making tonight. That&apos;s why we, Minister, think that this is the way to go. This would protect prospective employees. It has to be unreasonable in the circumstances. Minister, have you got a view in relation to &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;?</p> </speech>

<p>I want to ask questions, firstly, of Senator Cameron as the mover of these amendments. The minister made the assertion that this could apply to a prospective employee and that a business could be sued or could be subject to prosecution if it relates to something such as the travel costs of going to a job interview. As I read the legislative regime that this seeks to amend, I&apos;m just trying to understand whether Senator Cameron is saying that that&apos;s what these amendments are purporting to do. Under what circumstances does he say this will operate? Could I get clarification from the minister about whether it would be that broad, because that would seem surprising in the context of the legislative framework for this bill.</p> </speech>

<p>I thank Senator Xenophon for the question. What we are saying is that the demand has to be &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;. That&apos;s the test. We are not saying it is unreasonable for somebody who is going to a job interview to actually have to jump in the car, put petrol in the tank and drive through half-a-dozen tolls, as you would in Sydney. That&apos;s not &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;. But it would be &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos; for the employer to say, &apos;I&apos;ll give you a job, at minimum rate, but for you to get that job you&apos;ll have to pay me a fee of $500.&apos; That&apos;s what would be &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;. That is an issue that is clearly an unreasonable proposition. And that&apos;s why we say that, if the principle of &apos;unreasonable demands&apos; applies to those who have a job, you must make sure that prospective employees also don&apos;t face unreasonable demands. We are saying the demands have to be &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;. That would be the test. It would be tested by the Fair Work Commission; you could go there and say you had an unreasonable demand put upon you. We think it is appropriate to have these circumstances dealt with—that you cannot unreasonably demand money from a prospective employee. That&apos;s a problem people have faced.</p> </speech>

<p>Thanks for that clarification. I guess one aspect of this is how &apos;unreasonable&apos; would be determined, because there is an element of subjectivity. Senator Cameron gave an example that involved toll roads—and I get that. But what happens if the job is in Sydney, the applicant is in another state, the prospective employer says the interview can be done on Skype, the prospective employee is willing to travel to Sydney at their own expense and the employer says they would like them to come over but will not cover their expenses? Does that get into the realm of &apos;unreasonableness&apos;? I&apos;m not trying to be difficult. I think I understand what Senator Cameron is trying to achieve here, but I want to understand the circumstance in which it would work.</p><p>The legislation committee inquiry into this bill did hear evidence of one franchisee who was apparently offered a working visa and a job on the condition of the payment of $150,000. Now, that was a prospective employee, but I don&apos;t think there would be any question that that would be not just an unreasonable demand but an outrageous demand that ought to be the subject of heavy penalties and sanctions. I&apos;m trying to understand how this would be delineated. Time permitting, could the minister clarify why we wouldn&apos;t want to cover those situations where someone is saying they&apos;ll give you a job and a visa to stay here, but they want a kickback. That would clearly be outrageous, and I don&apos;t think anyone in this chamber would countenance that.</p> </speech>

<p>Take out the visa, because the visa is covered by other laws, and just have a claim of: &apos;We&apos;ll give you the job if you give us 150 grand&apos;—or $50 or $500. If the minister thinks the language we are using is so bad, I draw your attention to the fact that that is the language used in the bill—&apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;. All we are saying is that if the principle of &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos; applies to an employee then it should also apply to a prospective employee. I want to make the point that wage theft is rife in this country.</p><p>Through you, Chair: you&apos;ve been on the inquiry, Senator Xenophon. You&apos;ve seen some of the rip-offs that take place around this country. And we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. We believe, strongly, that the principle that applies in the body of the bill to an employee, using the same words that are in the body of the bill to define it—that is, &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;—should be applied to a prospective employee because, and I say it again: when someone is at their most vulnerable is when they are actually applying for the job. That&apos;s when they&apos;re at their most vulnerable.</p><p>We think your concerns should be covered by the position where the government&apos;s bill talks about &apos;unreasonable in the circumstances&apos;—that&apos;s the language in the bill. We think you simply apply that to prospective employees. Put your mind back to WorkChoices, where workers were fronting up for a job and being told, &apos;Sign or go away&apos;—sign away penalty rates, sign away annual leave loading, sign away minimum rates. That&apos;s what this government justified under WorkChoices. And this is another example of how we should be protecting prospective workers when they are at their most vulnerable: that is, when they are in a very powerless situation—trying to get a job—and when some of the most ruthless employers in this country would try to rip them off and steal from them. They should be protected.</p> </speech>

<p>I&apos;ve got a question here for Senator Cameron. It&apos;s pleasing to see that Senator Cameron now seems to know what the word &apos;reasonable&apos; means, after the last debate. Senator Cameron says that this only goes some of the way. Well, the Labor Party went none of the way. Now he says wage theft is rife around the country. Why did Senator Cameron and the Labor Party not do anything about this issue when they were in office for six years? Perhaps his focus was on protecting union bosses feathering their own nests?</p><p>And why would the Labor Party support the stealing of workers&apos; take-home pay in the form of higher energy prices due to the Labor-Greens climate and energy policies? That has really hurt workers and exported jobs, making more workers vulnerable. This is where all workers are most vulnerable. How can we, let alone vulnerable workers, trust this man and this party and their coalition with the socialist Greens, which is destroying this country?</p> </speech>

<p>I rise tonight with a heavy heart to reflect upon a tragedy that has happened in recent weeks that resulted in the loss of a little angel named Willow Walker in the Central West part of my home state. I have decided to reflect upon this for a number of reasons. Willow Walker, the daughter of Brooke and Daniel, and sister to her brother, Harley, was a child of the Collins and Walker families of the Central West in Queensland.</p><p>I had the privilege to be able to join the family, extended family, friends and, indeed, almost the entire community of the Central West as Willow&apos;s life was celebrated. I was particularly moved by a number of things that I saw. Firstly, the stoic and resilient approach taken by her parents as they celebrated this little girl&apos;s life was inspirational—nothing short of inspirational. Supported by the broader family, the grandparents and, indeed, the entire community of the district, in so many ways it really was a restoration in the faith of our communities. I&apos;m reflecting on this on the basis that these are rural communities. I think that the opportunity to provide support in these circumstances—the very nature of those communities, where everybody knows each other and everybody feels affected by these things, makes it easier or more likely for that support to happen in some of our smaller rural communities than we might sometimes see in larger metropolitan areas.</p><p>The entire Central West was affected by this enormous tragedy. It is an area that&apos;s remained under the heavy hand of drought now for four or five years. It remains one of the districts—there are many—in Australia that have not recovered from the impacts of drought and of market forces that have really challenged the economic and social stability of these places. In the midst of that, to see them rally around the Walker and Collins families around the loss of this little angel, Willow Walker, was something that I am unlikely to forget.</p><p>I felt so moved that I believe the circumstances need to be placed on the annals of our <i>Hansard</i> here in the federal parliament, to let all the Brookes and Daniels of Australia, who each face their own tragedies, many of which we don&apos;t learn about, know that we recognise their strengths. We recognise the strengths of their communities. They go to the very heart of what makes us Australians. They are deeply held in the culture and psyche of our people, who endure very difficult circumstances as they make their contributions to this nation. So I just wanted to say to Brooke, Daniel and Harley: the loss of Willow has not gone unnoticed. The impacts of how you celebrated her life were inspirational, and they will continue to play a part in underpinning this enormously important culture.</p> </speech>

<p>I rise to speak about the importance of sport in our community, particularly for people with disability. Last Saturday, I was fortunate enough to be invited by Futsal Tasmania to a game for players with intellectual disabilities between a Tasmanian team and a team from Tag 5 in Queensland. For those of you who don&apos;t know what futsal is, it&apos;s a five-a-side indoor football that is played throughout the world. The ball used in futsal is smaller and heavier than in outdoor football and has a reduced bounce. This forces a player to use their skill rather than the ball&apos;s bounce to propel it.</p><p>The first custom-built futsal stadium in Tasmania opened at Goodwood in southern Tasmanian only last year and, from my visits there, it seems to be going well. The manager of Futsal Tasmania, Romeo Frediani, helped organise the visit to Tasmania by the Queenslanders, and volunteer Matt Etherington coached the Tasmanians. Tag 5 was established in September 2008 and is supported and accredited by the Queensland government. The staff at Tag 5 are committed to enhancing the lives of people with a disability by providing them with the opportunity to be involved in sporting teams and recreational activities.</p><p>The Queensland Tag 5 futsal team came to Tasmania last week and played against a northern Tasmanian futsal team in Launceston. It was organised by New Horizons, who have been operating in the area for more than 30 years. New Horizons are:</p><p class="italic">… a vital link between people with disabilities and their hopes and dreams of becoming involved in activities that most people take for granted.</p><p>They rightly point out that sport is an ideal way of encouraging community inclusion and enhancing friendships. The visit by the Tag 5 Queensland futsal team certainly achieved that. After the Launceston game, which was won by the Queenslanders, both teams went out to dinner and I&apos;m told that some great friendships were formed.</p><p>As I said, on Saturday I was lucky enough to watch the second game between Tasmania and Queensland in Hobart and to meet the players and coaches from both teams. I confess to being a one-eyed, and at times vocal, Tasmanian supporter, but I wasn&apos;t alone. A group of boys, who had played earlier, led the Tassie cheer squad with regular chants of, &apos;Let&apos;s go Tassie, let&apos;s go.&apos; And go they did! It was an extremely exciting game, and Tasmania played very well. The Queensland team was made up of all males, but the Tasmanian team had one female, Meena, who was a powerful force with plenty of fancy footwork, but it wasn&apos;t just Meena who was very skilful. Many of the Tasmanian team had played street soccer and, while I am loath to single out any one particular individual, our invincible goal keeper, Corey, deserves special recognition. It was anyone&apos;s game right up until the end. Just when I thought Tassie had it in the bag, Queensland scored in the dying stages of the game and the final result was a six-all draw.</p><p>After the game, both teams enjoyed a barbecue, lots of photos were taken, and players shared their stories. The common theme in social media posts by the Queensland team was that the boys had an awesome time. I am pleased to report that in a replay on Sunday, the Tasmanian team defeated Queensland seven goals to five. Maybe the Queenslanders had trouble acclimatising—we did have snow on Sunday—but, as we know, people with disability encounter many challenges and barriers. As Paralympic swimmer Karni Liddell said:</p><p class="italic">People with disabilities want to be recognised for what they can do, not what they can&apos;t do.</p><p>So successful were the Tasmanian and Queensland futsal games that it will now become an annual event with teams from Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales also competing next year.</p><p>As Matt, who was the coach and also a volunteer, said: &apos;It&apos;s deeply empowering for the players to feel valued by our community.&apos; It was an extremely exciting game. The friendships that were formed throughout this competition in Tasmania, I&apos;m sure, will go on. I know that the Queenslanders, while shivering, enjoyed every moment of being in Tasmania, and the Tasmanian team enjoyed making new friends. That&apos;s what sport is all about. It is all about making new friends and it is all about including everyone.</p> </speech>

Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse </minor-heading>

<p>I rise to speak because yesterday the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse released the latest report in which it listed 85 proposed changes to the law. The issue that has made headlines overnight is the recommendation that priests report details of child sexual abuse they were told about during confession. Clergy who fail to report information about child sexual abuse heard during confession would face criminal charges. The Catholic Church, predictably, has shown it will oppose any move to force priests to breach the seal of the confessional booth and report paedophiles to police, despite calls from the royal commission to make it a legal requirement. I will have more to say about that in a minute, but there are other areas in the report that are worth noting.</p><p>There are five recommendations to reform sentencing practices. One would exclude good character references as a mitigating factor when a convicted paedophile is being sentenced. &apos;He&apos;s a good man, a community leader. He&apos;s never done it before.&apos; Actually, &apos;never been caught before&apos; would probably be more accurate—like shoplifters, &apos;It was spontaneous—first offence, Your Honour.&apos; Too often child abusers have been given a light or suspended sentence or community service after being convicted of horrible crimes against kids. In the report, there are 11 recommendations over crimes like grooming children for a sexual offence. We covered some of that, with the Senate&apos;s support, when we looked at Carly&apos;s law. We also now have the passport ban on Australians who are on the child sex offenders register.</p><p>But there is more to be done. I&apos;m working closely with the government on new laws targeting cyber sex trafficking. They should be introduced later this year, and I hope I get Senate support for it. I have talked before about a revolting use of Skype by Australian men exploiting poor Filipino families, paying $50 or $100 on their credit card to recruit mothers in the Philippines to use and abuse their own children for the gratification of sickos here in Australia. There are overdue recommendations to make it easier for children to give evidence, even pre-recorded evidence, and this is welcome to try to reduce the courtroom ordeals—the courtroom trauma—for children, the victims.</p><p>As I said, the issue that has garnered the most headlines and the most comments in the past 24 hours is the one introducing what I guess we can call third-party offences—failure to report and failure to protect. Under these recommendations, priests will be charged for failing to report confessions by parishioners of child sex offences. The church is defending the sanctity of the confessional—&apos;the seal&apos;. But I discovered today that before the 7th century confessions had to be made in public and genuine contrition had to be shown publicly before absolution could be given. I agree with the royal commission that priests should not be exempt. If a doctor or a teacher discovers evidence of child abuse, he or she must by law report it. Why should a priest be different? Canon law should never supersede Australian law.</p><p>It was well-put by the chief executive of the Truth, Justice and Healing Council, Francis Sullivan, when he said: &apos;This is a law seeking to protect children. You can&apos;t ask for a higher moral cause.&apos; The church should be saying, &apos;Amen to that&apos;.</p><p>I will take briefly a different slant to this, from a different religion. Under Sharia laws, some followers of the Islamic faith believe that taking of a child bride is normal and quite acceptable. Under Australian law &apos;child bride&apos; means &apos;child rape&apos;. A 12- or 13-year-old must be protected. A child rapist should be charged. Sharia law—a religious belief—is no defence in our courts, and neither should it be. So how is an imam defending a child rapist any different to a Catholic priest defending a paedophile in the confessional?</p><p>In the months ahead I will have more to say on this, and on a personal note I want to thank fellow senators and those in the other place, especially Prime Minister Turnbull and opposition leader Shorten, for making me the chairman of a joint parliamentary committee to be the national watchdog of the national redress scheme after the royal commission brings down its final report at the end of the year. We will do it with diligence, we will do it proudly and I thank you.</p> </speech>

<p>The title of my address tonight will be &apos;The ongoing saga of the Marella Jubes&apos;. Back in 1994 in what I humbly say was one of my better speeches, I told the Senate about how, while being addicted to the jubes, I had noticed a change in the composition of the lolly. They were no longer quite as hard as they used to be. So I wrote to Nestle and complained about this. They responded saying: &apos;Well, the ingredients used to be partly sourced from the UK and the USA. They&apos;re now entirely Australian ingredients. Sorry, but the texture is slightly less hard. But, to compensate me at the time, they sent me a whole box of Marella Jubes. Much as I was tempted, I did actually give the unopened box to the local Endeavour Foundation—it was at that time called the Sub-Normal Children&apos;s Welfare Association—in my hometown of Ayr. I came back to the Senate and I made a speech recounting this particular event.</p><p>That all came back to my mind just in this sitting session when a group of confectionery manufacturers came to see me and other parliamentarians representing sugar seats in Queensland. This group of confectionery makers were concerned about this ongoing campaign to denigrate sugar and they wanted us to be aware as representatives of sugar-growing areas of the impacts any suggested sugar tax or any demonising of sugar would have on work in our area and in other areas.</p><p>Mr Acting Deputy President O&apos;Sullivan, I was pleased to be joined by yourself, Mr Christensen, Mr O&apos;Dowd, Ms Landry, Mr Keith Pitt, Stuart Robert and Warren Entsch—all the members representing those seats plus some from New South Wales. We were concerned to hear the concern of the confectionery makers. These confectionery makers employ something like 8,000 people in their factories around Australia, mainly in the southern capitals, although there are some in my home state in Gympie and Carole Park in Brisbane. They are big employers of people in the manufacturing industry.</p><p>Of course, we all know that the sugar industry is the country&apos;s second-largest export crop after wheat. There are 35 million tonnes of sugar grown and four million tonnes of raw sugar exported each year. The value of production is $2.5 billion. Australia is the second-largest exporter of raw sugar in the world. There are some 16,000 people directly employed in the sugar industry and about 40,000 indirectly and directly employed. There are 4,000 cane farming small businesses across the country. Ninety-five per cent of Australia&apos;s sugar is grown in my home state of Queensland.</p><p>It was a useful get-together. As compensation for dragging us out of our busy day, the confectionery manufacturers all managed to bring a few samples for those attending and, lo and behold, there was an extra supply of Marella Jubes for me. I didn&apos;t donate them to some children&apos;s fund this time. Rather I donated them to our whip, who along with the Labor Party Whip, I noticed in an inspection just now, have these confectionery items near the doors of the whips&apos; offices. This is for the Whips to performance their worthwhile service in dispensing confectionery to overworked senators who, like today, often work from 9:30 to midnight and need an energy boost during a long day. The Marella jubes are for a worthwhile cause, but it is a serious message to dispense with this stupidity from some in our community who want to ban sugar. Sugar is a natural part of life.</p> </speech>

Freedom </minor-heading>

<p>The attitude of a lot of Australians towards freedom these days reminds me of the old tale of boiling a frog. The story goes that if you put a frog in a pot of boiling water it jumps out. But if you put it in the a pot of cold water and then slowly heat it, the frog doesn&apos;t notice the gradual increase in temperature and so it eventually boils alive. If 50 years ago, Australia had experienced a communist or fascist coup, which took away all our freedom at once, the average Australian would probably have taken to the streets to resist. But that didn&apos;t happen. Instead, our freedom has been quietly whittled away over decades and the average person doesn&apos;t seem to have noticed.</p><p>At the most minor end of the scale there is loss of the little things that help make life fun. For example, as kids we used to enjoy letting off fireworks on Guy Fawkes night. If we wanted to get some exercise, we used to be able to jump on a bicycle and go for a ride. Today, we can&apos;t do that unless we have a helmet. When I was a young man, I used to see school cadets travelling on buses and trams carrying their 303s and no-one batted an eye but, today, carrying a 303 on a bus would bring out the SWAT team.</p><p>Today we&apos;re told that we can&apos;t look after ourselves so socialised medicine is provided for all, not just the poor. A compulsory Medicare levy, which rises not with health risk but with income is also imposed on everyone, but it doesn&apos;t cover the costs so we also pay through our taxes. Fifty years ago, the roads were narrow, there were few dual carriage ways, and cars had drum brakes, crossply tyres and vague steering yet there was no speed limit on many open roads. Today, we have much safer roads, dual carriageways, ABS disc brakes, radial tyres, traction control and sophisticated suspension and steering, yet there are no areas without a speed limit and most areas are stuck at a maximum of 100km/h. People used to be free to say what they thought, even if some were offended, but now this is outlawed; the thoughts remain but they are buried away.</p><p>Under the guise of national security, we have growing encroachment on the media with prohibitions on the reporting of matters in the public interest. And of course, in its own little bit of Stalinism, the previous Labor government even tried to sensor the internet and gag the print media. Property rights are no longer sacrosanct with state and federal governments both taking greater and greater liberties with what we have worked and paid for. It&apos;s gone well beyond cutting down a few trees and now includes interfering with private rental and lease arrangements, such as being an Airbnb host.</p><p>The idea that we relinquish only a limited amount of our liberty in order to create a government that protects our lives, liberty and property has been lost. Our governments now believe they are our masters and we are their subjects. It is only when we look back that we realise how many restrictions on our liberty, from the petty to the great, have been foisted on us by stealth. It is time to wake up to what&apos;s ruining us as a nation and to tell all the nanny state control freaks, busy bodies and do-gooders where they can shove it. It is time to jump out of the pot before it&apos;s too late, because, let me tell you, the water is close to boiling.</p> </speech>

Tasmania: Tourism </minor-heading>

<p>It&apos;s my pleasure tonight to rise to speak about a very dedicated and enthusiastic group of locals who are dedicated to seeing the beautiful community of Waratah and surrounds preserved and put on the map as a tourism attraction. Waratah is a beautiful community in north-west Tasmania, in which I spent a lot of time as a child, and I&apos;m pleased to be talking about it tonight. The group I&apos;m referring to is to be commended for their efforts to promote this community, to secure its future through tourism and through historical preservation.</p><p>For those of you not familiar with the community, Waratah, south of Burnie and towards the west coast of Tasmania, is a spectacular former mining boom town. It was home to the great Mount Bischoff tin mine, which, in its heyday, was one of the world&apos;s richest tin mines. It was discovered in 1871 by a fellow by the name of James &apos;Philosopher&apos; Smith. It contributed not only to the Tasmanian economy but also to the national economy, along with mines like the Mount Lyell copper mine in Queenstown and the Dundas silver mine in Zeehan. Cities like Melbourne were beneficiaries of places like Waratah, Queenstown and Zeehan. Many of the buildings we see today were funded off the back of some of these very successful Tasmanian mines, which is an important thing to put on record for my Western Australia and Victorian colleagues.</p><p>Some of the other towns that this group is focusing on in the region are places like Magnet. A beautiful valley known as the Magnet valley was the site of a mining town which, in its heyday, was home to a couple of thousand people and boasted a great number of hotels, a hospital and three schools. Today there is nothing there. There are the foundations of the Catholic church, but there isn&apos;t a great deal more to show there was ever a bustling mine and a community to support it. It too generated a significant amount of wealth for the state, as a silver-lead mine. It was also the birthplace of a Tasmanian Labor luminary and former Premier, the late Eric Reece. Other spectacular locations in the region include the Luina township, the Cleveland mine and the Godkin mine, to name but a few. All of these locations are being reclaimed by the dense and beautiful rainforest. Very slowly, but surely, all of these towns are disappearing off the map. It is important to note that these towns contributed significantly, not only to the state&apos;s economy but to the nation&apos;s economy as well. I think it is important that we Tasmanians recognise the history that these communities have with regard to that economic contribution.</p><p>Turning to the group I mentioned at the beginning of my adjournment speech tonight, this group of dedicated locals not only are keen to see that we preserve what these communities mean to the state of Tasmania and to recognise the history of these communities but also are keen to put them on the map and promote them as a tourism attraction. The individuals in this group, Winston Nickols, Ann Dunham, Kim Kecely, Shane Pinner, Paul Ledger and Chris Hawkins, to name but a few, have been passionate advocates for these towns and this region. They have done a great job promoting what is special about this part of the world and chronicling the history of this community, which is something that I fear was slipping away over time. I&apos;m very grateful to them.</p><p>The projects they have been proposing to enhance this part of Tasmania include the Men of Rock museum, an interpretation centre which will be a great visitor attraction in the town of Waratah and will chronicle the history of the area and highlight its contribution to the economy and the history of our state; interpretive signage for a number of the aforementioned disappearing towns in our wilderness to show the significant contribution these towns have made to the economy but also to demonstrate how hard life was in these rugged and inhospitable parts of the country; the Pebble Pathway, which runs from Waratah to Temma, on the very wild west coast of Tasmania, was once walked by the Tasmanian Aborigines and, after them, the miners and prospectors of the region. The pathway is a 100-kilometre walk, which this group is hoping to open up as another walking trail, to add to the offerings we have in the state: the Overland Track and the Three Capes Track. I commend the group for their enthusiasm, and I encourage senators who aren&apos;t familiar with the region to come on down. I will give you a guided tour of the area myself. I commend the group and look forward to seeing these projects come to fruition.</p> </speech>

Share the Dignity </minor-heading>

<p>A few weeks ago, I had the great privilege of meeting with Rochelle Courtenay, who is the founder of Share the Dignity, a charity that distributes menstrual hygiene products to women and girls in need, Australia wide. Rochelle&apos;s message to me was clear: we, as policymakers and legislators, must do more to help disadvantaged and vulnerable women and girls to safely and hygienically manage their periods.</p><p>The stories Rochelle can tell to support this plea are harrowing. She recalls meeting a woman who had fled a violent relationship in her car, who explained that she had no choice but to improvise when she had her period. This woman sourced a pile of napkins, tore them down to size and laid several on top of each other before rolling them and inserting them as a makeshift tampon. Here&apos;s a woman who, after years of abuse, bravely fled her marital home with only the clothes on her back. She&apos;s isolated and she&apos;s scared, and she&apos;s stuck creating tampons from napkins because she simply cannot afford to buy the real thing. It&apos;s demeaning; it&apos;s unhygienic; and, to quote Rochelle, &apos;Where&apos;s the dignity in that?&apos;</p><p>Rochelle also told me that she&apos;d spoken to a South Australian doctor who said it was not uncommon for women and girls to suffer significant medical problems because they did not have access to pads and tampons during their periods. This doctor, who is based at one of Adelaide&apos;s major metropolitan hospitals, says that disadvantaged women and girls present to emergency departments with toxic shock syndrome, which can be fatal if it&apos;s not treated immediately. For the uninitiated: toxic shock syndrome is a rare and life-threatening form of blood poisoning. For women, toxic shock syndrome most commonly occurs in those who, to put it bluntly, do not or cannot change their tampons often enough. It&apos;s hard to believe that here in the lucky country a woman or a girl could be gravely ill or even die simply because she couldn&apos;t change her tampon. That&apos;s not hyperbole; it&apos;s not overkill; that&apos;s the sad reality for thousands of women and girls. Period poverty is here, and we need to do something about it.</p><p>In July this year the Scottish government announced that it would distribute free menstrual hygiene products to those in need as part of a six-month pilot program in Aberdeen. Launched by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, Angela Constance, the pilot scheme will make tampons and other sanitary items easily accessible to those who need them but cannot afford them. Pads and tampons will be funded by the Scottish government and provided for free at selected locations, such as secondary schools, shelters and food banks. It&apos;s the first program of its kind in the United Kingdom, and it&apos;s expected to help approximately 1,000 women and girls in its six-month trial. The Scottish government has recognised that to date its policies in this area have fallen short of what is needed to even begin to tackle period poverty.</p><p>The fact is that the situation described in Aberdeen is not at all dissimilar to the situation here in Australia. It&apos;s not unheard of for homeless and disadvantaged women and girls in Australia to suffer the indignity of using newspapers or dried leaves as makeshift pads. Some women steal these items. Some girls stay at home from school because their families cannot afford them. A similar pilot program in Australia would represent the first step in developing a sensitive and dignified solution to making these products easily accessible to those who need them.</p><p>That&apos;s why I&apos;m calling on the federal government to fund a similar trial here in Australia, and that&apos;s why it was so incredibly disappointing today that, when the government refused to support my motion for a trial, it claimed that funding for pads and tampons for disadvantaged girls and women did not meet the guidelines for the Public Health and Chronic Disease Grant Program family-planning activity. The last time I checked, periods weren&apos;t a chronic disease or a family-planning activity; however, they are a public health issue. That&apos;s why I&apos;m baffled as to why the government thinks it cannot fund the pilot program. I&apos;ll be pursuing this matter further.</p><p>As a nation, we can&apos;t let the rise in period poverty continue. Australia can do better. Australian women and girls deserve better. Menstrual hygiene products are a necessity, and access to these should be a right, not a privilege.</p> </speech>

<p>Post offices play an important role in our communities, especially across Australia&apos;s rural and regional communities, where they are places to meet and gather and, most importantly, places where Australians can access basic government and financial services. For those of us who live in the city, post offices are considered part of the landscape—a place to pick up a parcel, to get a passport or even, infrequently, to pay a bill. Soon, for a generation of young Australians they will be a place where they will be able to respond to the big postal survey.</p><p>However, for those living in rural and regional communities, licenced post offices are much more; they are often at the very heart of that community. People come to collect their mail but, more importantly, they rely on the services that regional post offices provide. Most importantly, it is often the only place where they can pay their bills and do their banking. It is often the one-and-only place where they can turn up in person with original documents to be certified or to get a passport photo taken.</p><p>This is why I was pleased that last week Australia Post announced that the Halls Creek post office, located in the Kimberley region of my home state of Western Australia, has been recognised as one of this year&apos;s Australia Post licensee award recipients for its excellence in customer service and post office operations, as well as its contribution not just to the town of Halls Creek but indeed to the whole Kimberley region. I am particularly pleased by the news because it was just two years ago that Halls Creek was faced with the possibility of losing its only licensed post office after numerous issues and complaints over serious delays in the delivery of letters and parcels, restricted and inconsistent opening hours, and customers often waiting in line for over an hour to be served. In February 2016 the Shire of Halls Creek took over the licence, and it was just over a year ago, on 27 May—my mother&apos;s birthday, by coincidence—that I cut the ribbon and opened the doors of the new post office with the Shire of Halls Creek president, Mr Malcolm Edwards.</p><p>The Halls Creek post office is not only the heart of the local Halls Creek community, allowing the community to access a range of services, including passport services, police checks and other identify checks, it is also, critically, serving as the sole banking facility in the town and for surrounding remote communities like Balgo, Mulan, Billiluna and Ringer Soak.</p><p>Having reliable postal and banking services restored in the town of Halls Creek has been a great boost to the community, and I congratulate Halls Creek shire president, Malcolm Edwards, the Shire of Halls Creek itself and its manager, Anthony King, on this outstanding achievement. I&apos;m delighted to have been part of the journey of the Halls Creek licensed post office thus far.</p> </speech>

<p>I rise to put on the record this week, before too much more time passes, a reaction to a speech given in this place by Senator McKim yesterday. He used a speech on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 to launch an extraordinary and unwarranted attack on a very successful and important part of our industrial relations architecture here in the country, the SDA—the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees&apos; Association—one of Australia&apos;s largest trade unions.</p><p>Senator McKim alleged that the SDA was actively colluding with big business to undercut its members on their pay and conditions. This is just an outrageous claim to be making in this place. To use parliamentary privilege to make such a false claim was an insult to this place, and certainly an insult to all those who are working in the retail sector and to all those delegates who are working to make sure that, through the SDA, the conditions of work that they have to work in are being attended to and that they are being defended properly by the union.</p><p>The SDA has negotiated very strong wage deals for hundreds and thousands of members since its inception. To have Senator McKim rise in this place and claim that the SDA, the union that looks after workers in the retail sector, has undermined penalty rates is absolutely an outrageous and false claim. In fact, it was the SDA and United Voice which bore the cost of the penalty rates decision and both the SDA and United Voice are also currently bearing the cost of the review into the decision and are continuing to fight the cut to penalty rates. That&apos;s what they do. They have been looking after workers and making sure they get fair and good conditions for a very, very long time. They continue to do that work, despite the comments from Senator McKim yesterday.</p><p>We need to get some facts on the table here. In Victoria, it was the SDA that established double time on Sundays in its modern award—a fantastic benefit for many workers, but particularly for women workers. Women, when getting local employment in the area in which they live, find that a shop is a place in which you can recommence that journey into work. And for so many young people, this a vital part of their entry into the workforce, and they need to have the protection of a great union that is there to support young people getting fair and generous wages for the skills and opportunities that they are developing for themselves.</p><p>The SDA has been able to secure some of the highest pay rates for fast-food workers in the world. That is a great outcome for our local economy as people go to work, get fair and decent wages, take their wages into the local community and pay into other small businesses to keep that economy moving around. The more we take out of the pockets of low-paid workers, the worse it is for our local economy, and that&apos;s absolutely clear to Australians who live in regional Australia in particular.</p><p>Because of the work of the SDA, at McDonald&apos;s, a full-time senior weekly wage is $50 to $65 a week higher than the fast-food award, and the enterprise bargaining agreement contains superior conditions, such as things that matter to people who are working—things like guaranteed minimum shifts of 10 hours per week to allow for planning and budgeting; shorter maximum shifts; and, when needed, compassionate leave, study leave and domestic violence leave. These things are part of the civility of our country, and they have been achieved by the union that Senator McKim chose to malign yesterday. The McDonald&apos;s EBA also contains a very strong annual wage increase between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent.</p><p>This disappointing criticism only highlights the fact that the Greens party is not loyal to hardworking members of our economy, people who are participating in the retail sector. They are supporting rogue unions. The unions they seem to support in opposition to the SDA were nowhere to be seen when the 7-Eleven cases needed to be prosecuted and advanced in the public place. The 7-Eleven cases that the community would be aware of, which were so prominent last year, were in fact brought to attention and prosecuted on behalf of those workers by the SDA. They fought for people who had no association with the union but who needed a strong voice for justice and fairness, in the public place. So I will not have the record of Senator McKim stand against the outstanding work of the SDA over many, many decades for ordinary, hardworking Australians who the Labor Party will always look after. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

Tasmania: Industry </minor-heading>

<p>I want to speak in relation to the trip I took around Tasmania, when I went to visit, speak with and listen to people from within the agriculture sector, the aquaculture sector, the tourism sector and the IT sector. These are the sectors that quite frankly are the backbone of the Tasmanian economy. I wanted to go and listen to any concerns they had, because this is all part of developing our policies to take to the next election. But it was so rewarding to hear the enthusiasm of these people that I met with from various sectors in talking about the opportunities that are going to be there for them and in the broader sector to which I was referring.</p><p>It was great to hear about the current issues, as I said, and their achievements and to see the passion that they have for the important work that they do to make Tasmania great not only as a destination to visit but to live and work in. These industries are the backbone of Tasmania&apos;s economy, and the opportunities in these sectors outnumber the challenges they face. In Tasmania&apos;s salmon industry—and I have visited Petuna seafood on a number of occasions—they employ over 5,200 people throughout Tasmania, and the bulk of those people are employed full time in regional Tasmania. So we&apos;re talking about the contribution to our economy of $626 million. That&apos;s a significant contribution to the state&apos;s economy. And we know that over the next 15 years, and beyond, the demand for seafood is going to double. That means there will be a lot more jobs created.</p><p>I went to meet with people from Huon Aquaculture—in Hobart, actually. I had an overview of what they contribute to the salmon industry, and it was really interesting. The reason I went on this particular occasion was to look, learn and understand how they&apos;re using the IT sector to change the way that they manage the fish farming in their facilities. It was really quite fascinating. Some of it still relatively new, and very exciting, but in the interests of their business it is not something that we can openly talk about.</p><p>I travelled from the north-west coast through to the north of the state and then down to the south. Tasmanians would know the House of Anvers, in the north of Tasmania, as a fantastic chocolate maker and tourism destination. The House of Anvers was started in 1989 by Igor Van Gerwen, who came to Australia from Belgium. With his knowledge and expertise, and with a combination of Tasmania&apos;s cream, pure butter, liqueurs and natural flavours, he makes some of the best chocolates you will find anywhere. With the rich flavours and fantastic primary products that he uses, he&apos;s able to bring to not only the Tasmanian confectionary sector but also the tourism sector some of the best truffles and fudges you will find anywhere in the world. If you add to that what Igor Van Gerwen is doing for the local communities, for local visitors, the House of Anvers is certainly a destination you must go to when you&apos;re travelling from the north-west coast to the north of the state. And Ashgrove Tasmanian Farm is one of the finest cheese producers in Tasmania. They built a family business into one of the leading cheese producers in Tasmania. That has certainly enabled Tasmania to claim that we really are one of the best cheese-making regions in this country. Pair all of this with Tasmania&apos;s breathtaking beauty and world-class foodie stops and it&apos;s not hard to understand why more and more people are choosing Tasmania as a destination.</p><p>But with all these great products and natural beauty, Tasmania is still very much reliant upon the government investing in infrastructure. So I want to turn to another sector which is vitally important to Tasmanian&apos;s economy. I hosted a roundtable with the IT sector in Hobart. I was fortunate enough to have with me the shadow minister for the digital economy, Ed Husic, the Tasmanian Labor member for Denison and the shadow minister for communications, enterprise and the digital economy, Madeleine Ogilvie. We had some fantastic representatives from the Tasmanian IT sector—TasICT, Journey VR and Simon Tyrrell from LiveTiles. I can&apos;t begin to express how excited I get with the enthusiasm that these people have in their recognition of how important the digital economy is to Tasmania&apos;s future economy. But every time I meet with these people—and I&apos;ve been doing it quite often—I hear some wonderful stories. I don&apos;t know how many horse men and women we have in this chamber, but a little known fact is that a company in Tasmania has created a new innovative hoof boot, the Scoot Boot, which enables horses to move over all sorts of terrain more safely. It&apos;s much better for them than the old ways of shoeing horses. This small company, which operates out of Hobart, has broken into the US market, they are breaking into the English market, and I have no doubt that they will make inroads into European countries that appreciate horses and sporting events as much as we here in Australia do.</p><p>That is just one of the many stories you hear when you&apos;re out talking to people and, more importantly, listening to the innovative ideas that are coming to fruition in Tasmania. But it&apos;s very unfortunate that this government, along with the state Liberal government, has actually vacated this space. There is no real injection of funds to assist this growing, emerging and very important economy—important not only to my home state of Tasmania but also to Australia. Because of where we are located, and even though not all of it is the great NBN that we rolled out, we can actually become the digital hub of the southern Pacific, in terms of where we&apos;re actually situated, if we are to invest money to support this sector—because there isn&apos;t any money anywhere.</p><p>I talked about aquaculture and how the digital economy and IT are helping them to farm their fish better and more efficiently. Whether you&apos;re talking about health or you&apos;re talking about education, the digital age is here. The only limitations that we have as a state will be brought about by governments, both at the state level and here at the federal level, not investing and supporting that sector. That is the future. We need to ensure that our children are fully digitally aware and educated so that they can take these jobs of the future. We are a very creative community. We have the best living conditions of anywhere in this country. We have some fantastic digital companies that are innovative and that are prepared to mentor and to be part of the digital hub. We need to grasp that with both hands. We need to support that sector and we need to see some leadership from this government, who have vacated this space. And I don&apos;t even want to go into how disappointed the IT sector is with the state government and the way they have abandoned their responsibilities of investing any real money into this sector.</p> </speech>

Montara Oil Spill </minor-heading>

<p>On Monday next week, 21 August, it will be eight years since the Montara oil spill disaster off the coast of Western Australia. Thousands of barrels—in fact, we don&apos;t know the final amount—of oil began leaking from the Montara wellhead platform drill rig into the Timor Sea. It continued to leak for more than 10 weeks, before finally being stopped on 3 November 2009.</p><p>Three weeks after the spill—remember, oil was coming out of that wellhead for another seven weeks after this—the size of the spill was reported by the government as being 25 nautical miles by 70 nautical miles. The oil spill entered into Indonesian waters. On top of this, thousands of litres of different types of dispersants were also spread on the oil spill. The area is bigger than the size of the City of Perth, and the Montara oil spill is now considered as Australia&apos;s worst ever offshore drilling accident.</p><p>PTTEP Australasia was the company that owned the drill rig. They did finally admit that the oil did go into Indonesian waters, as well as Australian waters, and acknowledged that mistakes had been made. In fact, there was a commission of inquiry into the disaster that clearly pointed out where the problems lay. There were some changes made to legislation as a result of the oil spill; however, what has never been fully addressed is the fact that there was oil leaked into Indonesian waters, and it actually reached East Nusa Tenggara and the islands of Nusa Tenggara Timur and Rote Island. The issues around the impact on the fishers, the seaweed farmers and the families around the area of East Nusa Tenggara and the coastline have never been properly dealt with.</p><p>We know that the Montara oil did leak into Indonesian waters, because the fishers had video of it and they collected the oil at that time. In fact, I tried to get it tested in Perth and then I handed it over to the commission of inquiry, and they established beyond all doubt that that oil was actually from the Montara oil spill. What we&apos;ll never know is the true extent of the damage to the environment, as there was no baseline study conducted in the area before the oil spill. Nevertheless, although at the moment we don&apos;t know the impact on the marine environment, there is still a chance we can find out the extent of the spread of the oil spill.</p><p>The reason this is important is that once-thriving communities on Nusa Tenggara Timur and Rote believe they have had significant impact from the oil spill. I have been to Kupang and to the villages of Nusa Tenggara Timur and have met with villagers. I have met with fishers and seaweed farmers and been in the villages. You could tell that villages that were once prosperous are no longer prosperous. When I was there, fish markets that were once thriving were extremely quiet. The fishers report that the number of fish caught has reduced. Seaweed farmers went from three tonnes of seaweed per farmer to half a tonne of seaweed. They have diminished livelihoods and they also have health effects. Families report they have had to pull children out of school because they can no longer afford to access basic education. They have also had to try to find other livelihoods—some more successful than others. They have deep concerns that their incomes and lives have been deeply affected by the oil spill.</p><p>Unfortunately, this has been never been properly studied. On top of the oil itself, we also need to consider the fact that the chemical dispersants were sprayed onto the ocean to disperse the oil into the seabed of the Timor Sea. We know that there were a number of chemicals used—in fact, some were used during the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, which actually started not long after the Montara oil spill started. Some of those chemicals and dispersants have since ceased their use and have been banned. The seaweed farmers and fishers display skin diseases which they also think were caused by the oil.</p><p>The true extent of the contamination of the waters surrounding East Nusa Tenggara has never been studied. Innocent people, their families, fishers, seaweed farmers and children continue to address the difficulties they think were caused by the effects of this oil spill. Successive governments have done little to address the issues that the seaweed farmers and the fishers continue to raise. Yes, PTTEP Australasia was fined $510,000, which is a good deal less than the estimated economic loss due to the pollution of the sea. The provincial government of East Nusa Tenggara has estimated it at many hundreds of millions of dollars. There has been no move to compensate the victims of the Montara oil spill or even to discuss with them the issues around the oil spill. There is a class action now underway by seaweed farmers and fishers; however, we know how long class actions take, and I don&apos;t want to comment on that any further.</p><p>Since 2014, the Indonesian government has been looking at this issue and has asked for further assistance. I will acknowledge that the current foreign minister, as I understand it, has actually raised this issue with the Indonesian government. The asks of the community at the moment are not extensive asks. What they&apos;re asking for is a study of where the oil might have been.</p><p>My first reaction to that, was, &apos;Well, the spill&apos;s happened.&apos; But what I understand from the scientific experts on this issue is that you can still find traces of oil. Because each different oil type has its different fingerprint, they can still find traces of the oil in the sediment and around the coastline. If they can look, they feel that they would be able to establish the extent of the spill. At this stage, people aren&apos;t saying it is definitely the Montara oil spill; they&apos;re saying that the diseases of the seaweed farm and the drop in production—again, I have seen that with my own eyes—started occurring around those dates. I have seen the impacts of the skin diseases and spoken to fishers about the impacts.</p><p>What they&apos;re saying is, &apos;Please fund a study for us to look at whether in fact there was an impact of this oil from the spill on the coastlines and on the seaweed farms.&apos; What they&apos;re saying in order to facilitate that is: &apos;Please, could the Australian government and the Indonesian government set up a task force to work together to drive the study to make sure it occurs and to make sure we start getting some action here?&apos;</p><p>And then, of course, if the study does show that there are impacts on the marine environment around east Nusantara, Timor and Roti, it is expected that there should be compensation for those people who are affected. It seems very unfair and it doesn&apos;t seem too hard for the company that was involved to actually make sure that there was no impact. To me, it doesn&apos;t seem too hard for the Australian government to take leadership on this matter, given that this spill happened in our waters and on our watch, and that, along with the company, it was our regulatory system that failed. The regulatory system in place at the time did not do its job properly and, of course, there were mistakes made by the company.</p><p>The eighth anniversary should be a time for the Australian government to show leadership: to say, &apos;Yes, we will help form this task force, and we will make sure that the study gets funded.&apos; To my mind, the company should be funding the study. I will keep pursuing this; it&apos;s eight years down the track and we need to keep pursuing it. I will show a movie on Thursday in Parliament House—a documentary made by Jane Hammond, a local WA film maker. It&apos;s called <i>A Crude Injustice</i> and it is about this and the impacts that it had on the local community in West Timor and Roti. I urge people in Parliament House to come to see it.</p> </speech>

Asylum Seekers </minor-heading>

<p>I rise to speak on a matter of profound importance to Australia&apos;s identity as a compassionate and fair nation. This country&apos;s migration policy for refugees and asylum seekers has become an international disgrace. It has been four years since asylum seekers and refugees have been incarcerated in detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island. And when I recently attended a vigil on the lawns of Tasmania&apos;s parliament house, to join with the local community from Hobart and in solidarity with people all around Australia to light a candle for the men, women and children who languish in limbo in those offshore detention centres, I realised just how long the community in our country has been asking for our government to end this incarceration and uphold our international human rights obligations.</p><p><i>The Guardian</i> <i>&apos;s</i> published Nauru files, reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, the <i>At what cost</i> report by Save The Children Australia and the work of organisations like the United Nations Higher Commission for Refugees and many others have painted a desperate picture: limited access to basic necessities, frequent exposure to harm, violence and abuse—including the sexual assault of children—and significant harm to mental health, leading to self-harm and suicide. With their futures stuck in this torturous indefinite confinement, they have waited and waited and waited, and slowly been driven mad.</p><p>The Papua New Guinea High Court has ruled that the detention of refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island&apos;s relocation centre is unconstitutional and is illegal. The High Court has ruled that the detention of refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island is a fundamental breach of their human rights. The court has ruled that the centre must be closed, and Papua New Guinea&apos;s High Court&apos;s ruling is a clear signal of just how wrong we&apos;ve got things. It is the clearest sign that the government needs to do better; it must do better. Yet the situation has not got better, in fact, it has got worse. As of 31 July, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection reports that some 791 people remain on Manus Island and 371 people remain on Nauru. The rest of the world looks at our actions with dismay and disbelief that we could treat people in this way—people who sought refuge in our country. Heather Higginbottom is the former US Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources under the Obama administration. She has recently written in Time Magazine about the administration&apos;s opposition to our policy and that the foundation for the swap arrangement with Australia was, in fact, a desire to assist the people who we refuse to assist. She wrote:</p><p class="italic">These are people who risked their lives on makeshift boats to flee conflict and the lack of access to basic means of survival but were turned back by an Australian government that refuses asylum seekers who arrive by sea. As we fuss and fret over the clash of presidential and prime ministerial personalities, actual human beings suffer.</p><p>That is correct—actual human beings suffer and have continued to suffer over the last four years.</p><p>Last week, the UN High Commissioner for refugees made a statement:</p><p class="italic">UN Refugee Agency is gravely concerned by deteriorating conditions at the Manus Island ‘Regional Processing Centre’, as authorities seek to relocate people to Lorengau or elsewhere in Papua New Guinea. The announcement of the closure of the Centre, in the absence of appropriate alternatives, is causing acute distress among refugees and asylum-seekers. UNHCR is deeply saddened by the tragic death of a young refugee yesterday, which also highlights the precarious situation for vulnerable people on Manus Island.</p><p>I too am saddened by the death of Hamed Shamshiripour. We&apos;re told that Hamed suffered acute mental illness for over a year. We are told that his condition was known to authorities and that concern for his welfare was repeatedly raised by his fellow asylum seekers, refugee advocates and others yet he died under our watch in a camp run by Australian Border Force, and this government doesn&apos;t even care to investigate why. The power in the Manus Island detention centre has been cut off, access to water is limited, the newly built transit centre reportedly has just 300 beds—less than half of what is required—and current residents of the centre are being threatened with criminal charges if they do not move.</p><p>With these on going attacks on asylum seekers and the death of five people since Operation Sovereign Borders began, detainees are understandably stressed and terrified to break point. To argue that the serious and real fears for the welfare of detainees that are raised over and over and over are merely a matter for PNG and that Australia can just wash our hands is an act of such terrible cowardice by this Turnbull government. We cannot abdicate responsibility for what occurs on Manus Island. The people who suffer and die there are there because our government placed them there and because our government kept them there for years and years on end. They came to us for help, and our fear politics sent them away. It banished them to this island prison. The government paid for these camps so the government is responsible for the consequences of what goes on at these camps and for our actions. Even US President Donald Trump wonders why we are doing this. After being told these people are not bad in his leaked phone call with the Prime Minister, President Trump said:</p><p class="italic">Well, maybe you should let them out of prison.</p><p>This was Donald Trump saying this. Who would have thought I&apos;d be quoting Donald Trump in a speech! Is there anything more telling or more deplorable than the Prime Minister&apos;s assurance to US President Donald Trump that:</p><p class="italic">We will take anyone that you want us to … So we would rather take a not very attractive guy that help you out then to take a Noble [sic] Peace Prize winner that comes by boat. That is the point.</p><p>Those three sentences go to Australia&apos;s reputation as a decent and sensible country, right there, in the words of our own Prime Minister.</p><p>So what does that mean? That means that Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi and Thomas Mann, among others—Nobel laureates; refugees—are the kinds of people that Malcolm Turnbull would keep out of Australia if they travelled by boat, which many of them, in fact, did. They&apos;re the people Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull would keep out of Australia so that he could let in anyone that the US wanted us to let in, even if they were &apos;not very attractive guys&apos;. He told President Donald Trump that he didn&apos;t even need to take a single refugee—that there was just a need to be holding up an appearance of compliance. That just shows you the lack of compassion, lack of understanding and lack of resolving the issues in our immigration policy by this Prime Minister.</p><p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in relation to the deal: &apos;It does not oblige you to take one person that you do not want. The obligation is to only go through the process.&apos; How ridiculous! What kind of Prime Minister, what kind of leader, do we have who says that? What a terrible, terrible sham: a swap where we take whoever the US doesn&apos;t want and, in return, they are obligated to take no-one. How is that in anyone&apos;s interest, let alone our own national interest? And where does it leave the people on Manus Island and Nauru?</p><p>What this ultimately comes down to isn&apos;t politics. It&apos;s not about winning a vote or wedging opponents. It isn&apos;t about slogans or catch-phrases. It&apos;s about people&apos;s lives—people with families; people with hopes and dreams; people who came to us for help. And we cannot turn them away. <i>(Time expired)</i></p> </speech>

<p>There are some organisations that we come across that we realise do incredible work within our communities. One of those is CanTeen. They do an amazing job providing support and services for young people living with cancer. Cancer is a terrible disease. It wreaks utter havoc on people&apos;s lives. In particular, it can be an extremely difficult time if you&apos;re a teenager or young adult and you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer. It can be scary and it can be isolating. You can feel like you&apos;re alone, or that you need to take on responsibility far ahead of your years. But if you&apos;re one of these young people, there is a community of other young people across Australia who are in the same situation and who you can turn to for advice and support. CanTeen is an incredible resource and is there to help.</p><p>I was fortunate enough recently to be invited to the Tasmanian headquarters of CanTeen to meet with staff, volunteers and some teens who access their services. They talked me through their range of programs and services, and I heard from people at all levels of the organisation, including the national CEO, young people whose lives have been affected by cancer, psychosocial support staff, young people in leadership positions and a cancer support nurse. I would sincerely like to thank them for providing me with a better insight into what CanTeen is about and the services CanTeen offers.</p><p>So, if you&apos;re aged between 12 and 25 and your life has been affected by cancer, either through having the disease yourself or having a sibling or a parent with the disease, CanTeen offers services that you may find of assistance. Also, if you&apos;re a parent with cancer, there are resources and information that may help you to talk to the young people in your life about your cancer journey.</p><p>Many still see CanTeen as just camps for young people who have cancer. However, its core functions have grown significantly since it was founded a little over 30 years ago. CanTeen does amazing work supporting young people. It really does transform lives. CanTeen allows young people to connect to peers in similar situations and provides phone, email, online and face-to-face counselling, information about living with cancer or living with a loved one with cancer, and youth cancer services.</p><p>It provides opportunities for young people affected by cancer to escape the pressures of their daily lives for a while and to make some new friends. CanTeen camps and recreation days give young cancer patients space away from the daily pressure of living with cancer. They can meet other young people affected by cancer who really understand what they&apos;re going through and can learn new ways to cope with cancer. The camps don&apos;t only deal with some of the hard stuff; there&apos;re always lots of fun activities and lots of chill-out time as well.</p><p>CanTeen programs are always free and can be anything from half a day to five days long. One of the amazing things about them is that CanTeen organises all aspects of the camps, including accommodation, transport, meals and all activities, to ensure that these events are stress free for the participants. As I said, the camps are a great way to meet new friends who have a real understanding of what young people living with cancer are going through. Importantly, CanTeen also provides information about cancer, its treatment and what to expect. The website canteen.org.au is full of useful information.</p><p>An area where CanTeen has really expanded in recent years is in its counselling services and peer support. CanTeen counselling services are flexible so that young cancer patients can talk to a counsellor when they like and how they like. They can get support from a counsellor over the phone, on live chat or by sending CanTeen an email. Support is available seven days a week, no matter where you live, with phone support available until 10 pm. Young people with cancer can join the CanTeen community through its website to connect with other young people in similar situations. CanTeen also has face-to-face counselling available in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Newcastle, as well as a group support program called TRUCE for young people dealing with the cancer of one of their parents. A young person with cancer can call CanTeen on 1800 835932 or email them at support@canteen.org.au to find out more and to organise a time to see a counsellor.</p><p>CanTeen has created a great peer-to-peer network online that allows the thousands of young Australians living with cancer to talk through their issues with others who have been in the same situation. It can be really helpful to read other people&apos;s real-life stories and realise that you&apos;re not alone in what you are feeling. CanTeen also provides great leadership opportunities, with the organisation underpinned by a philosophy of having young people at the centre of everything it does. Members can participate in local leadership groups which enable them to get involved according to their interest and skill in areas such as governance, advocacy and fundraising and as a powerful support to one another online, in person and through programs.</p><p>One amazing fact about CanTeen is that it was set up by a group of young cancer patients in 1985 and still has young people affected by cancer guiding their organisation at every level. There are many opportunities for young people to get involved as valued contributors to the organisation. Every young person is empowered as an expert in their own wellbeing, which is really critical. They can also sign up to become a member—there&apos;s no charge—to exercise their vote on matters which affect them and the future of CanTeen. Each local leadership group elects a representative onto CanTeen&apos;s national Member Advisory Council, which is chaired by CanTeen&apos;s national president. CanTeen&apos;s also unique in that the majority of the board of directors are young leaders elected by the Member Advisory Council. The board chair is elected by the board and must also be a young person. You can see that it&apos;s a really inclusive, democratic process for young people.</p><p>CanTeen services—as I said earlier, their camps are free—are all free to participants. While they receive some state and Commonwealth funding, they still need to raise significant funds by fundraising each year. Their big national fundraiser is the National Bandanna Day, and this year National Bandanna Day is being held on Friday, 27 October, so put it in your diary. Individuals, schools and other community groups can take part by selling bandanas and by holding a National Bandanna Day fundraiser on the day. You could combine the bandana selling with something like an afternoon tea, a barbecue or other function to help raise some money for this very worthy cause. You&apos;ll be raising money to help CanTeen support young people when cancer crashes into their world.</p><p>Recently, CanTeen in Hobart held their Curioser and Curioser quiz night. I was glad to assist this worthy cause by donating a prize. Unfortunately, I was away on committee work and couldn&apos;t attend, but I hear the night was an incredible success: big congratulations to the hardworking team down in Hobart. One of the reasons I fought so hard for the establishment of the Senate inquiry into low-survival-rate cancers is the devastating impact the disease has on children and young people. Through the course of the inquiry I have heard many not only sad but terrible stories of young people&apos;s lives being affected by this disease. I believe we must do whatever we can to improve survival rates. That&apos;s why I&apos;m so thankful that an organisation like CanTeen exists, to make the experience of young people affected by cancer just that little bit easier.</p><p>Thanks, again, to CanTeen Australian CEO Peter Orchard and Tasmania manager Shae Chester for hosting me at CanTeen&apos;s Hobart office and to Madeleine, Sally, Vic, Alex, Sarah and Michelle for talking to me about the very important work each and every one of them does. If you know of a young person whose life has been affected by cancer and who is not in contact with CanTeen, can I please encourage you to put them in contact with this organisation, because there is no doubt that it will make their journey through their cancer episode just that little bit better. It won&apos;t stop the cancer, but it will certainly make them feeling less alone and isolated. I have had so many young people tell me how isolated they felt when given a diagnosis. This is really important work. If I can just encourage everybody: please, if you know of a young person affected by cancer, put them in contact with CanTeen. It is a very worthwhile cause.</p> </speech>

Food Certification, El-Mouelhy, Mr Mohamed </minor-heading>

<p>I concur, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was recently reading the Australian government&apos;s response to the report of the inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee into the third-party certification of food. The response has been nearly two years in the making and basically says that the committee was an excellent committee, that it reached some very reasonable conclusions and that the government is still considering how to implement those conclusions. But I was drawn to one particular part of it, which said:</p><p class="italic">… the Government … will also consider amendments to the <i>Export Control (Meat and Meat Products) Orders 2005</i> to strengthen oversight and monitoring of halal certification for export, which will also include an option for the Government to be the sole signatory on halal certificates for export—</p><p>in essence, a government-led halal certification system. This is because halal certification is ridded with scams and rorts. It is an additional tariff, if you will, to get access to particular markets.</p><p>People will have different views about that, but one of the things it reminded me of is perhaps one of the vilest and grubbiest individuals that I&apos;ve ever had the fortune to have never met. This is a bloke named Mohamed El-Mouelhy. Mr El-Mouelhy boasts openly that he is one of Australia&apos;s multimillionaire halal certifiers. He taunts people regularly about how much money he makes and how he certifies water and everything else. In effect, this bloke is ripping off Australians. He is a scammer. I believe he is a crook, and I will tell you exactly why I&apos;m saying that. I know he is a serial liar. I know he is a person who is of poor character, and he is a notorious bigot.</p><p>I say those things—I&apos;ve said them on radio; I&apos;ve said them out in the public sphere—because this is a man who has admitted to bribing people through his halal certification fees. He is a man who admits to supplying money to an Islamic charity which was demonstrated links to Hamas and Hezbollah, proscribed organisations. He proudly boasts about the quantum of money he gives them. He has admitted, in public, to effectively ripping off the Australian taxpayer through halal certification. He has blatantly lied, repeatedly, about me and many others. This is, perhaps, one of the worst examples of our immigration program in the history of this country, and I don&apos;t say that lightly. This is a bloke who came here in 1975, became an Australian citizen in 1981 and has been basically ripping us off ever since.</p><p>In recent times this scammer teamed up with a bunch of other colourful characters to launch a coup, as it was described in the media, to take over a crooked organisation called AFIC, Australian Federation of Islamic Councils. When they appeared before the halal certification inquiry they were unable to explain: their own books, how they were a not-for-profit making profit out of halal certification, where the money went and what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars they took over. These are people that are in charge of those dodgy Malek Fahd schools, which the government has had to shut down multiple times, because these people are ripping stuff out of the system.</p><p>One bunch of crooks thought the other bunch of crooks weren&apos;t doing a bad enough job, so they went to take it over. The courts, having to decide between two crooked outfits, decided to put the first bunch of crooks back. Mr El-Mouelhy was out of another angle of a scam. But, because he didn&apos;t want to be dissuaded from being in the public eye, Mr El-Mouelhy decided to double-down on his stupidity. He thought that he would set a new standard in idiocy. I am basing this on his own standards. This is a new level of idiocy. This is a man who is not very bright, judging by his Facebook photos and judging by what he puts on Facebook, because he describes himself as a halal chief and boasts about billions of dollars&apos; worth of exports that he has generated for Australia, but he also says that Australian women need Muslim men to fertilise them. Can you believe that? He wrote that on his Facebook page:</p><p class="italic">…Australian women need us—</p><p>Muslim men</p><p>…to fertilise them to keep them surrounded by Muslim babies—</p><p>while declaring</p><p>…the white race will be extinct in 40 years.</p><p>This is a self-proclaimed giant of the halal certification industry. He&apos;s a crook and he&apos;s an idiot, but what sort of a place is it when we have clowns like this setting themselves up as representatives of the Muslim community?</p><p>As I said, Mr El-Mouelhy is not very bright. He can&apos;t be very bright, but he knows how to run a good scam. His vision of Australia is:</p><p class="italic">It will be mandatory for all women to wear hijab or burka.</p><p>That&apos;s Mr El-Mouelhy vision for the future: where everything in Australia will be halal certified. But he doesn&apos;t stop there. He says:</p><p class="italic">When that happens everything in Australia will be Halal certified. Bigots and pigs will be declared Haram—</p><p>which is—Senator Dastyari, can you help me?</p> </speech>

The problem is that everything Mr El-Mouelhy says is inextricably linked to one of the most vile characters that you could ever imagine in the business community. We don&apos;t accept people doing the wrong thing in business, and yet this is a bloke who proudly does it. This is a bloke who says that Australian women will be desperate for Muslim men to fertilise them so that they can have Muslim babies everywhere. And you think that&apos;s satire? You think that&apos;s acceptable, Senator Dastyari, from a Muslim community leader that apparently many in the Muslim community look up to, because they want to link with him to take over AFIC?

Queensland: Day for Girls </minor-heading>

<p>Last Saturday I joined more than 200 women and some men at Maroochydore in Queensland to celebrate the first birthday of the Maroochydore Day for Girls program. It was a joyous event, and it was made even more joyous by the fact that we were joined at that event by the Australian leader of the Day for Girls program as well as a number of women who have worked in this program for many years.</p><p>This wonderful program has a mission that is dedicated to creating a more free, dignified and educated world through providing lasting access to feminine hygiene solutions and health education. The Maroochydore Day for Girls program has now joined with more than 800 chapters of this group across the world that are working in more than 100 countries and which, up to this stage, has helped more than 640,000 women across the planet. The program works in so many countries to help break the stigma and taboo surrounding menstruation and empowering women and girls to initially be able to go to school, and then to get work and to ensure that they are as powerful and as independent as they can be.</p><p>The international founder of this organisation, Celeste Mergens, created this organisation with a small number of people in 2008. She says:</p><p class="italic">There are so many things in this world that are hard, but this is not one of them. This we can change. Together!</p><p>We know, and the evidence is clear, that there is an urgent need for menstrual hygiene solutions around the world. There are 1.5 billion women of reproductive age in the world; 300 million of those women live on less than $1.25 a day and will struggle to meet their basic needs for food, shelter, water and hygiene solutions. Reviews found that, particularly in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, at least half of the girls in the populations sampled did not have or did not know about adequate access to hygiene solutions. The studies are clearly documented. In Kenya, which is a relatively well developed country, it&apos;s estimated that 2.6 million girls—2.2 million primary and 400,000 secondary schoolgirls—require support to obtain menstrual hygiene materials. Approximately 300,000 of them, owing to cultural practices, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, would require both sanitary towels and underwear, at an estimated cost of 2.6 Kenyan shillings. There is a desperate need, and this data can be replicated in many, many areas.</p><p>Interestingly enough, earlier this evening, in a contribution by Senator Kakoschke-Moore, we heard about a splendid program in Australia which is working for dignity for women in Australia who have difficulty with being able to afford these programs, and there is a wonderful program through many churches and schools where people are able to donate to ensure that the program can provide menstrual products to women in need in Australia. But there is a different level of need about which we are talking with the Days for Girls program services.</p><p>I really encourage people to learn more about the program. There is a splendid international website which provides a really valuable map of the world which looks at the locations where the program is operating and the areas where there has been an absolute involvement in the process. The Days for Girls program empowers and unites women, connecting extraordinarily passionate volunteers and key community members. When you work with the Days for Girls program, you find women who are practical and committed and who share a community of purpose which they believe in. Work that they can do in their own homes through creating the kits can make a direct link to women in need around the world. That&apos;s shown in the map, where you can see the number of Days for Girls programs in Australia and you see the number of countries where the kits are available.</p><p>Certainly in Australia a lot of the focus has been in the Pacific. I first met Days for Girls in the Solomon Islands. Senator Fierravanti-Wells and I were talking this afternoon about visiting the Solomon Islands. Visiting the domestic violence shelter there, I met a number of Australian volunteers who were working in the Solomon Islands, and they were talking about Days for Girls. That&apos;s how I met the women. I shared their passion, their commitment and also the international links that are created by women working together.</p><p>There is nothing more uniting for women than the issues around menstruation. This is something women understand and share, and women have practical responses. This is where this program unites, it allows empowerment and it also creates fantastic sisterhood, because the women in places like Maroochydore not only get together regularly to create the kits—and I&apos;ll talk about what&apos;s in them soon—but then have the opportunity to travel to the area where the kits are used to meet the women who have the need and then create further networks and further sisterhood, which then builds the volunteer base. So the model of Days for Girls is based on active volunteers who get involved and then build the network so that they can then have further interaction and in many cases create enterprises in the local communities. Certainly, it&apos;s working very well in parts of Africa. We&apos;re hoping to be able to extend this to the Pacific, with the kits being created in areas such as Australia. Then you go to a place—hopefully the Solomon Islands will be one—where the knowledge can be shared so women at the other end of the cycle are then able to create the kits themselves and turn them into local business enterprises. So not only do you have the empowerment of getting rid of the taboo and the exclusion of not being part of your wider community when you&apos;re menstruating, but you can build employment, economic participation and new life by ensuring that you are then able to have the enterprises at work in the local areas.</p><p>On the website it reinforces comments from the people themselves who have been changed by their involvement in the Days for Girls programs, and I am so impassioned by reading the direct quotes of people who&apos;ve been involved—quotes like:</p><p class="italic">I love being on the front lines of this revolution! A worldwide community of women. By women. For women.</p><p>We also have the extraordinary example of where the kits are very practically created. On the website it says exactly what&apos;s in them: basic things like washcloths, Ziploc freezer bags, absorbent trifold pads, drawstring bags, moisture barrier shields—things that can be made here, gathered together and sent out with a personal message from the person who makes them that says, &apos;This is for you,&apos; immediately creating a communication which gives that sense of empowerment, that sense of being part of much more than just your local community.</p><p>I really encourage people to have a look at the dynamic Facebook page for this organisation in Australia. There we see information that is shared by women across Australia who are part of the program. One of my favourites is one that you would understand, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams: the YWAM Medical Ships, of which we&apos;ve spoken many times in this place and which go from Townsville to the coastal areas in New Guinea. We see photographs on that web page of Days for Girls packs created in Townsville, put on the ships and then taken to New Guinea, our nearest neighbours. We can see again this wonderful organisation created by a woman who saw a need and then saw a practical way to make a difference.</p><p>When Celeste said, &apos;There are lots of things that are difficult to change in the world, but this isn&apos;t one of them,&apos; that was a clear challenge to all of us, and in fact it has worked. Since 2008 over 600,000 kits have been distributed to women across the world. They&apos;re moving towards having a million kits in the next few years. This we can change. We can change it together.</p><p>I add that they have now linked Days for Girls kits to the Sustainable Development Goals. The Sustainable Development Goals 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 17 are all directly impacted by this group of passionate volunteers who work together—by women, for women, together—for all women across our globe.</p> </speech>

Charlottesville: Attacks </minor-heading>

<p>I want to speak about the appalling acts of violence by Nazis in Charlottesville in the US on the weekend and to speak about the death of Ms Heather Heyer, a brave 32-year-old who lost her life while protesting against hatred. She was run down by a car driven by a Nazi. Many other people were injured.</p><p>What happened in Charlottesville on the weekend was an act of terrorism. This conclusion is absolutely inescapable. What&apos;s happened in the United States has been the clearest demonstration—if we needed one—of how easily hateful words can become hateful deeds. If you&apos;re not outraged, you&apos;re not paying attention.</p><p>In response to Charlottesville, what did we get from Donald Trump? A mealy-mouthed statement about the violence that, in his words, &apos;many sides&apos; had committed. Donald Trump has not only embraced but encouraged extremist elements within the US society. He&apos;s brought many of them, in fact, right into the heart of his administration. So perhaps his timid, mealy-mouthed response shouldn&apos;t surprise, but it is in any event an abject failure of leadership.</p><p>But tonight I warn that parts of our political class here in Australia are sleepwalking us in the same direction that the United States is going. Frighteningly, we risk the same consequences. In response to the atrocity at Charlottesville, what we got from our Prime Minister was radio silence—no emergency meetings of important-sounding committees, no condemnation of the attack at all, no urgent review of the terror warning, no flag-clad press conferences, not even actually a press release. If you&apos;re not outraged, you&apos;re not paying attention.</p><p>Of course, our Prime Minister&apos;s political career has been defined by his coddling of and his compromising with extremists in his own party. He&apos;s allowed those people to set his government&apos;s agenda, and he&apos;s refused to hold them to account for their words and their actions. He didn&apos;t offer a syllable of protest when a member of his government, Mr Christensen, spoke at a Reclaim Australia rally. Reclaim Australia is a group that has at least one of its members facing terrorism charges. Nor did Mr Turnbull lift a finger to prevent Mr Christensen going onto a white supremacist podcast, where he laughed it up with anti-Semites and Nazis. This is despite the ASIO head, Duncan Lewis, warning about the threat posed by radical right-wing groups and telling a Senate committee that that threat is increasing. Mr Turnbull has done nothing to reprimand Mr Christensen. If you&apos;re not outraged, you&apos;re not paying attention.</p><p>Mr Turnbull has allowed the ongoing torture and the deliberate causing of harm to people seeking asylum in our country on Manus Island and Nauru under the watch of his immigration minister, Mr Dutton. Our Prime Minister has appeased Mr Dutton—if you like, rewarded him—for the harm he&apos;s deliberately causing to some of our fellow human beings by giving him greatly increased ministerial powers and supporting him in the introduction of citizenship laws that passed through the House this week that have got throwbacks to the White Australia policy. At a time when racism in this country is on the rise, Mr Turnbull ignored multicultural Australia and the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country to try and gut the protections against hate speech contained in the Racial Discrimination Act. If you&apos;re not outraged, you&apos;re not paying attention.</p><p>But the extremism in this country is not contained to this building. There&apos;s also an increasingly radical element to the media, with obvious but frightening parallels to the United States. It&apos;s of course difficult to think of a more egregious example than <i>Quadrant</i>&apos;s Roger Franklin, who called for the ABC to be bombed. We shouldn&apos;t overlook the consistent racism of people like Andrew Bolt and people like his News Corp stablemates, Gary Johns and Jennifer Oriol, whose writing contains horrific elements that range from racist dog whistling to downright racist foghorning. Look at the disgraceful campaign against Yassmin Abdel-Magied, who was basically run out of the country for a seven-word Facebook post. She was run out of the country, I might add, by the very people who claim to support freedom of speech in Australia. This was a vindictive effort by some of the worst elements of this parliament and the press—notably, Prue MacSween, who said she&apos;d like to run Yassmin over. If you&apos;re not outraged, you&apos;re not paying attention.</p><p>Whilst Sky News has in its employ a good deal of credible journalists, by night that channel becomes a fiesta of the far right, where people who should be unemployable spew vitriol and whip up hatred against minorities in this country. Even triple j had a neo-Nazi on this week to argue his case. We shouldn&apos;t dismiss the threats that hate speech pose just because they come from mainstream outlets. Nor can false balance be used to justify giving airtime to Nazis. It&apos;s extraordinary that someone even needs to say this in our country today. What&apos;s happening in Australia, driven by elements in this parliament and in the media, is nothing less than the continued normalisation of extremism.</p><p>We cannot continue sleepwalking in this country until we see a repeat of Charlottesville on our own lands. We cannot allow the continued attacks on multicultural communities and on minority groups in this country and the continued setting of one group of Australians against another. We cannot allow our Prime Minister to continue to appease and give succour to extremists, whether they be in his own party or in the media or in the wider community. We cannot and we must not sit silently by as our rights are eroded and our harmony undermined.</p><p>Heather Heyer&apos;s last Facebook post before she was murdered in an act of terror by a Nazi in Charlottesville on the weekend was this:</p><p class="italic">If you&apos;re not outraged, you&apos;re not paying attention.</p><p>Let&apos;s honour her memory. Let&apos;s pay attention, let&apos;s get outraged and let&apos;s fight back.</p> </speech>

<p>Mr John Wilson made a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into whistleblower protections in the corporate, public and not-for-profit sectors. That submission was not accepted and, as far as I know, Mr Wilson didn&apos;t receive any explanation for that. This is despite the fact that the terms of reference to the inquiry included:</p><p class="italic">… measures needed to ensure effective access to justice, including legal services, for persons who make or may make disclosures and require access to protection as a whistleblower; …</p><p>I&apos;m delivering this speech tonight to put some of his concerns on the record. I do note that Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, also raised this matter on 28 March 2007.</p><p>Mr Wilson&apos;s submission argues that ASIO poses a distinct threat to whistleblowers. There is solid evidence for it, and any recommendations by the committee that do not address this threat will leave Australian whistleblowers vulnerable. There is clear and compelling evidence of ASIO interference with whistleblowers in a range of cases, including John Wilson&apos;s.</p><p>I will read excerpts from John Wilson&apos;s submission: &apos;I worked as a mining analyst for SG Warburg, now part of UBS, in New York on Wall Street in the mid-1990s and followed Freeport-McMoRan as part of my portfolio of company coverage. The company owns the large Grasberg copper and gold mine in West Papua and at the time was under investigation by the US State Department following allegations it was involved in the killing of indigenous protesters there. A research note I wrote and which was published by Warburg touched on the killings, and the next thing I knew I had the FBI, and ASIO in Australia, interfering with my life and career. I have had problems with the agencies ever since and have not been able to make any meaningful progress seeking accountability through the established democratic oversight channels—media, legal and oversight agencies—all deeply infiltrated and blocked by ASIO.</p><p>&apos;The agencies&apos; surveillance of and interference with me and my family since then has been completely intrusive and unreasonable. I have been blacklisted and intensely bullied—the result, I believe, of being labelled as acting in association with a whistleblower.</p><p>&apos;I have approached the main oversight agency for ASIO, IGIS, on multiple occasions but found its treatment of my case inconsistent, weak and misleading, and its treatment towards me evasive. Not once has IGIS offered to interview me, nor has it approached any of the witnesses I put forward. Its behaviour and response to my complaint about ASIO is consistent with that of a captive regulator—one that acts foremost to protect the reputation of the agency it oversees and not as it is mandated to do, which is to serve in the primary interests of justice, to protect individual citizens unfairly targeted or abused. I have had no satisfaction corresponding with IGIS, nor in taking other steps through various official channels to resolve the matter. I have had three one-hour meetings with the former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock in the past few years to discuss this issue, but without results.</p><p>&apos;I have no rights to know on what assumptions ASIO or IGIS are operating, as everything is done in secret. Finding even my appointed lawyers interfered with, the media tainted or controlled and IGIS unreliable and unresponsive, what means do people in my situation have to protect themselves from egregious intelligence community conduct?</p><p>With a sense of futility at other options, I turned to social media and started an issues-focused blog: mining analysis.net.&apos;</p><p>&apos;Justice Hope recommended 30 years ago that there be a standing royal commission into the Australian intelligence agencies that encompasses IGIS to keep IGIS fully accountable and to keep policy makers well informed as to what intelligence agencies are actually doing. But his recommendation was never implemented and, as such, there is a large gap in the justice system. People with credible and reasonable complaints about ASIO, including whistleblowers, have no way of having their claims independently investigated.&apos;</p><p>&apos;Never before has so little been known about their activities, capability and mission of our intelligence community. Never before have the penalties been so great for whistleblowers and media that reveal any information about agency activities including historic activities.&apos;</p><p>&apos;Secrecy and reporting of their activities have been tightened, a media blackout and penalties increased for media violations and whistleblowers with 10-year prison terms. At the same time as the crackdown on transparency, agency budgets have greatly expanded and technological capability and power to intervene in the lives of citizens have increased dramatically with ever more powerful computers, improvements in telecommunications and new secretive alliances with offshore partners, both commercial and state.&apos;</p><p>&apos;The scope for abuse is huge and it is easy for the agencies to act outside their mandate with impunity. Ian Barker QC, a prominent Australian lawyer, proclaimed his frustration with the abuses of ASIO and by corollary the lack of credible oversight, commenting: &apos;Any defence lawyer having anything to do with a case involving ASIO will know its agents habitually act outside their powers and routinely abuse them, always in secret. It is rare indeed for their conduct to be exposed.&apos;</p><p>&apos;This risk posed by ASIO to whistleblowers and those associated in the leaking process threatens every Australian. The more power that ASIO has, the greater that risk becomes and the more need there is for new effective oversight methods. Any and every whistleblower in Australia faces fear and uncertainty concerning censorship and retaliation at the hands of our intelligence agencies. I draw your attention to an article from The Sydney Morning Herald, from 18 October, 2016, &apos;Fear, censorship and retaliation: United Nations rapporteur slams Australia&apos;s human rights record&apos; and to the excerpt below concerning Australia&apos;s intelligence agency abuses of whistleblowers, as identified by a recent scathing UNHCR report 3.&apos;</p><p>This is a quote John Wilson included in his submission:</p><p class="italic">Australia lacks adequate protections for human rights defenders and has created &quot;an atmosphere of fear, censorship and retaliation&quot; among activists, according to a United Nations special rapporteur.</p><p class="italic">Michel Forst, who released an end-of-mission statement on Tuesday after a fortnight in Australia, said he was &quot;astonished&quot; by numerous measures heaping &quot;enormous pressure&quot; on public servants, whistleblowers and ordinary citizens.</p><p>There are further extracts from John&apos;s submission. Julian Burnside QC stated in relation to ASIO legislation:</p><p class="italic">National security is defined in a way which takes it way beyond what most people would understand by the term. ‘National security’ is defined to mean: ‘Australia’s defence, security, international relations or law enforcement interest’… International relations is defined to mean political, military, and economic relations with foreign governments and international organisations.”</p><p>&apos;As such, my matter, in their opinion, is one ASIO could be involved in – since it touches on US corporate interests. No further justification is needed. I could be targeted for publishing information provided by a whistleblower. No further justification is needed.&apos;</p><p>&apos;Julian Burnside&apos;s definition makes clear, and which accords with my personal experience, the intelligence agencies of the Five Eyes alliance closely protect American business interests, like Freeport McMoRan&apos;s in West Papua, even where those interests involve highly contentious operating practices which would never be tolerated in a First World country or by a free people.&apos;</p><p>Mr Wilson&apos;s allegations have never been properly dealt with. This case amplifies the need for effective protection for whistleblowers and others associated with them; otherwise, ASIO and other intelligence agencies can take retribution.</p><p>On another matter, I love our rail system. Though it&apos;s inadequate, it&apos;s something to be deeply proud of. Our forebears had a vision to create a wonderful network of rail systems across the whole country—something that, when it was designed, was clearly designed for the future, not just the population of that time. I&apos;m incredibly proud of our rail workers in the city and the country, on the light rail system, in the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and in the other unions that rail workers are members of. What particularly interests me are the timetables. The level of organisation in the rail system is deeply phenomenal. It must have been incredible before there were computerised systems.</p><p>When you talk about systems, we really need to remember how important it is that they&apos;re integrated. If you come from New South Wales, we&apos;re going backwards.    While the Berejiklian government might tell you about their wonderful light rail and the rail systems they&apos;re bringing, they&apos;re really Balkanising the rail system. Many of you would remember how we used to have these lessons in primary school—that is my memory—about the ridiculous situation that Australia had, decades and decades ago, where rail systems varied between states, and what a problem it was. You often had to get off in the middle of the night to change trains at Albury or wherever because the gauges didn&apos;t match. Well, in 2017 in Sydney, we&apos;re back to exactly the same system.</p><p>We have a new light rail system being built in Sydney at the moment, and it has just come out that it doesn&apos;t match with the light rail system that already exists. Say you want, as many people do, to catch a tram from the inner west, around Dulwich Hill, to go over to the sports ground—to the huge sports facilities. Tens of thousands of people go there. You can&apos;t catch one tram; you will have to change, because of the inefficiency and inability of the current Liberal-National state government to run a proper transport system. Why is that? It&apos;s because they are beholden to the market, because they&apos;re selling off our once-wonderful public transport system more and more to the private sector.</p><p>Here is a bit about what&apos;s happened. Sydney&apos;s inner west light rail line and the new $2.1 billion line from the central city to the south-east won&apos;t be able to switch from one to the other. They are the two lines that I&apos;m talking about. The word that they use is &apos;interoperability&apos;, and that&apos;s what should&apos;ve been put in place between the two lines. But now we have this huge limitation in terms of the movement of passengers. To emphasise: it&apos;s been done because this government is captured by the market, because that&apos;s who they went to. They didn&apos;t have a public transport authority, they didn&apos;t have a department of public transport that could do this work and they didn&apos;t have a department of public works that had the corporate knowledge to be able to undertake these important projects. And they want to take everything to the marketplace. That&apos;s where they went for the light rail projects. And now we have a disaster.</p><p>And it doesn&apos;t stop there. The rail system through the Blue Mountains urgently needs an upgrade. What do we find? We learn that the long, long overdue upgrade doesn&apos;t all match up. We have an incredible system now which will mean that the New South Wales government will need to modify station platforms and rail lines in the Blue Mountains because the new fleet of inner city trains—they are very welcome, but they cost a lot of money at about $2.3 billion—will be too wide to make the trips between some of the stations once you get into the higher part of the mountains. It is extraordinary that that&apos;s been allowed to happen. They&apos;re too wide to travel between Springwood and Katoomba and Lithgow on the Blue Mountains line. Why is that? It&apos;s because this section of the line can only handle carriages narrower than three metres. Anybody in the vicinity of this area knows that it&apos;s very winding. It&apos;s through the Blue Mountains. The terrain is difficult. Surely you would start off by taking some measurement so you knew what you were going to do. But, no, that hasn&apos;t happened, and we have this absolute mess of a system because of the way it has been mismanaged.</p><p>The minister responsible is Andrew Constance. He&apos;s trying to make excuses, saying, &apos;Well, we always planned to make some modifications.&apos; This isn&apos;t modifications; it&apos;s an extreme stuff-up. Those two incidents with the light rail and the Blue Mountains line are a real reminder of how we need a national coordinated approach to our rail services.</p><p>So it was very refreshing this week when I had the opportunity to meet with a number of rail builders and railway workers, members of the AMWU, who are here lobbying about precisely that, because the AMWU is working to promote high-quality, sustainable Australian manufacturing jobs in rail. What&apos;s been clearly identified is that, if we have strategic local content that delivers for the national interest, it will help boost manufacturing, help boost jobs in this country and deliver that coordinated approach, so you wouldn&apos;t have these shocking mistakes because of the reliance on the market and companies working together and a lack of coordination, largely because of that traditional excuse that they bring out, &apos;commercial-in-confidence&apos;. What we have from the AMWU I certainly support very strongly. They have got a set of recommendations here that really should be acted on by this government. Any federal government should be giving leadership in this area.</p><p>Their first recommendation is:</p><p class="italic">Gain a comprehensive sense of problem and opportunity … State-based planning, design and procurement arrangements should be commissioned. This should encourage all local manufacturers, suppliers, organised labour and rail operators to develop case studies quantifying the costs and risks of the current system.</p><p>Again, if this were done, I wonder if Sydney would be in this embarrassing situation that could lead as an unfortunate example of what the risks are in the current system. It goes on:</p><p class="italic">The process should model the benefits of moving to a national approach with a single source of national standards …</p><p>They were the words that I so welcomed when the workers sat in my office and spoke about that. It was workers from the Hunter, not far from where I live, and from other areas around the country, all identifying the great benefits that would come if we had this single source of national standards. The country would save much money and, at the same time, generate so much work and so many jobs here, because a big part of this is for the rail rolling stock to be made in Australia.</p><p>Recommendation 2 is:</p><p class="italic">Implement a proven national rail reform structure … The Prime Minister and Premiers should examine the merits of establishing a national public transport authority where all States and Commonwealth are equity shareholders in a common structure that minimises the fragmentation of the sector …</p><p>Again, that is important language there—&apos;minimises the fragmentation of the sector&apos;. It is time at a federal level that the government stepped up and got involved in a much more hands-on way with these projects, working solidly with our states. It is urgently needed.</p><p>Recommendation 3 is:</p><p class="italic">Use the reformed structure to drive better labour strategies</p><p>That&apos;s where we can have long-term growth in jobs. A little bit of history here is interesting. In its 2013 report for the Australasian rail association, Deloitte found that state governments would purchase approximately $30 billion of public transport rail rolling stock between them over the 30 years to 2043. This would reflect rolling stock demand that would grow from around 4,000 cars nationwide in 2013 to almost 11,000 by 2043. I share those figures to show the potential of jobs growth and the urgent need to expand public transport. I understand that since that study was done there&apos;s been more extensive work undertaken because of the growth of interest in the public sector, not just from the public but also as more governments come to their senses and recognise that if we&apos;re going to deal with reducing greenhouse gas emissions, moving people effectively and increasing business productivity then public transport is the answer.</p><p>So these are some wonderful ideas that have come from the AMWU. What goes hand in hand with that is a deep commitment to TAFE and a deep commitment to expanding our number of apprentices—sadly, in recent times the numbers have crashed. By bringing all this work together, we can have a fine future for public transport and jobs growth in the rail sector if governments will come on board. It is time the federal government gave leadership.</p> </speech>

Australia-United States Relationship </minor-heading>

<p>Should Australia distinguish between wars of choice and wars of necessity, as my colleague Senator Xenophon argued in this place yesterday? Should Australia be in charge of its own destiny and not blindly follow others into areas of conflict? Absolutely. This is even more the case when you consider the position we now find ourselves in, with the very real prospect of the United States and North Korea facing off against each other.</p><p>Our past has always been one of reliance on major powers. Since our inception, we have fought alongside Britain in empire wars; and, in return, Britain defended us when we needed them. We turned to the US for help when the realities of World War II drew close. The evolution of the Cold War, and in turn conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, saw us cosy up even closer to the US and other allies. When the Iron Curtain fell, and peace replaced war, our dependence on global superpowers should have waned. Instead, rather than becoming strategically independent and making our own decisions in line with national priorities, we have become increasingly bound by the decisions of the US and others. We have become more closely entwined and committed to American foreign policy than ever before. This was perhaps most starkly illustrated by the increased presence of US marines stationed in Darwin and the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap, which is used for military spying operations throughout the Middle East, Eurasia and the western Pacific. Now our blind loyalty is being demanded once more, with President Trump rallying allies as he escalates his rhetoric towards North Korea.</p><p>It would seem that caution and restraint of American foreign policy has been scrapped in favour of a full-throttle approach by the new administration. While checks and balances have thwarted some of the President&apos;s legislative reforms, as Commander-in-Chief, he has unfettered control of his military.</p><p>President Obama told Australian troops in 2011: &apos;You can&apos;t tell where our guys end and you guys begin.&apos; While the sentiment may have been genial, that blurred line makes America&apos;s enemies our enemies too. With recent events unfolding much faster than expected, an increasingly worrying picture is beginning to emerge. Tensions are rising, and North Korea is closer than ever before to launching missiles into American territory. While this is of course extremely concerning, it is important that we take a very measured approach. However, Prime Minister Turnbull is using the current conflict as an opportunity to cosy up to the US, rather than putting Australia&apos;s interests first—using statements like, &apos;Australia and the US are joined at the hip&apos;, &apos;The United States has no stronger ally than Australia&apos;, and &apos;Australia and the US will always stand together&apos;. We haven&apos;t heard this kind of rhetoric from an Australian Prime Minister since the Iraq War. Our Prime Minister declared that the 1951 ANZUS treaty will be invoked should North Korea attack the US.</p><p>The question that comes to my mind is: why the haste to commit ourselves to a possible regional conflict? Even the experts are questioning why the Prime Minister went so hard, so quickly. Professor John Blaxland, international security expert from ANU and former director of joint intelligence operations for the Australian Defence Force, has described the PM&apos;s comments as &apos;extraordinary&apos; and &apos;surprisingly forthright&apos;. The Prime Minister&apos;s own foreign minister even took a step back, adopting a much more measured approach, pointing out that under the ANZUS alliance or the Korean war armistice, &apos;Australia would not automatically be involved were there any catastrophic conflict on the Korean Peninsula&apos;—and rightly so.</p><p>The ANZUS alliance states that, if there was an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of the parties, countries are required to consult on joint military action. Prime Minister Turnbull&apos;s declaration that Australia would be in lock step with the US is far from consultation, and, according to Professor James Curran from the US Studies Centre, the pre-emptive declaration is very much unprecedented.</p><p>It&apos;s also important to remember that the treaty has only been invoked once before, by John Howard in consultation with the respective allies following the September 11 attacks. We can&apos;t be or be seen to be wilfully following the US into another conflict without consideration of our own position and national interests. If we do, we risk finding ourselves in a similar situation to that of the Iraq War. While opinions are still split on the merits of Australia&apos;s involvement in the Iraq War, I believe we should follow the UK&apos;s example and reconsider how decisions about military actions are made, including, as Senator Xenophon mentioned yesterday, by subjecting them to parliamentary debate.</p><p>There is no doubt that our relationship with the US remains one of our most important, but that affiliation mustn&apos;t be our only focus and we mustn&apos;t favour that alliance over our own national interests. A recent report from the Australian National University&apos;s National Security College recommended the federal government reframe our engagement with the US and prioritise the national interest, strengthening ties with our regional neighbours. China is our largest trading partner and an increasingly important friend. We must not let ourselves be led by the Trump administration down a path that seeks to damage this relationship or others like it. It is time to move beyond the hand-holding with President Trump. Prime Minister Turnbull mustn&apos;t automatically get swept up in the United States&apos;s fire and fury. Of course we need to respect our alliance with the US, but the US should not expect that we will blindly follow whatever decision they make. We need to make these decisions nationally and rationally, and in our own best interests—Australia&apos;s interests.</p> </speech>

# who-s-my-mate
This is a single-page web app that runs on top of Marklogic XML server. It helps you find out who's on your side of Australian politics.

Who's My Mate is targeted to busy Australians who have little time to follow the political discussion but wish to make informed decisions on election days. You might also find it useful if you want to follow the debate around the hottest political topics by Australia's top politicians.

For other developers, the data from http://data.openaustralia.org/ offers heaps of possibilities to extend the current application. Some interesting additions might include a search for the hot topics over a given period of time or a recommendation of the party that would best advance your agenda.
